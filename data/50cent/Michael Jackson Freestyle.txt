They say I ain't lyrical! They say I ain't a miracle (yeah!)
I say some hard shit so they say I ain't spiritual! (uh-huh!)
They act like they know God better than me

Allah O Akbar clap him run through your backyard
Let the Mack off! - Tear half off your back off. (whoooooooohhhooooooooooooooo!) [gunshot]

But this time let me tell you where I'm at! (Well, I'm in SouthSide!)
You don't have to worry - 'cause I'm coming! (Haha!)
