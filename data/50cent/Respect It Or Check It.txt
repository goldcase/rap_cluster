"Respect It Or Check It"



[5 seconds instrumental]

[Intro:]
"FOREVER KING"!

[Bridge:]
Some niggaz jus' wanna smoke! - Some niggaz wanna smoke niggaz... [gunshot]
Some niggaz sell coke! - Some niggaz sellin' dope nigga... [gunshot] {COME ON!}
We all hood, different pedigrees
Now! - Che-che-che-che- check out my melody! [Tarzan shouts]
You fuck around I catch a felony...
Now! - Che-che-che-che- check out my melody! {LET'S GO!}

[Chorus:]
Since a little nigga I been on my own
Me, I hold a chrome, you don't think,
So respect it or check it nigga!
That shorty shit is over now I'm grown
Me, I'm full blown, you don't think,
So respect it or check it nigga!

[Verse 1:]
I don't know if I'm worse when I'm rich or when I'm broke niggaz
Same attitude you got it go 'head smoke nigga! [gunshot]
I'm fuckin' with a blonde bitch I got my own fragrance
Power by 50 goddamn it I think I made it! {HAHA!}
I tried to keep it basic, they wanna complicate shit,
The Feds on my phone that's why I don't ever say shit.
Portray bein' a friend to me and I'll make you a memory, [police sirens]
The .40 Cali burn you be smokin' like a chimney! [police sirens] {DAMN!}
Niggaz sick of pussy shit and me I'm jus' a remedy!
'03 "Get Rich", nigga you remember me? [rewind]

[Interlude:]
Ayo pull that back, man!
Ayo play that again man, youkno'msayin'?

Some niggaz jus' wanna smoke! - Some niggaz wanna smoke niggaz... [gunshot] {DAMN!}
Some niggaz sell coke! - Some niggaz sellin' dope nigga... [gunshot] {DAMN!}
We all hood, different pedigrees
Now! - Che-che-che-che- check out my melody!
You fuck around I catch a felony...

Power by 50, goddamn it; I think I made it!
I tried to keep it basic, they wanna complicate shit,
The Feds on my phone that's why I don't ever say shit.
Portray bein' a friend to me and I'll make you a memory,

Niggaz sick of pussy shit and me I'm jus' a remedy!
'03 "Get Rich", nigga you remember me?
Shorty rock her hips she get to lookin' like a entree [scream]
Bad bitch phat ass bouncin' it' like Beyonc
