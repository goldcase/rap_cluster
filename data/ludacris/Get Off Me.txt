LUDACRIS LYRICS




"Get Off Me"
(feat. Pastor Troy)



[Ludacris & Pastor Troy]
what (what), what (what), what (what), what (what)
I (I ), I (I ), I (I ), I (I )
[Pastor Troy]
OK, come on, what 
[Ludacris & Pastor Troy]
what (what), what (what), what (what), what (what)
oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oohhhh)

[Chorus: Ludacris]
Get off me, but I'm on you all day
Get off me, I don't think you wanna play
[repeat 2x]

[Luda] You wanna rush me, you can't touch me, trust me
cause you weigh too dusty, and rusty, and musty
[Troy] You betta shop that make you pop up from lock up
but you tell your folks to hold you're jack up to back up (to back up)
[Luda] I'm ready, so sit down or go ta' your room
[Troy] It ain't nothinnnnn
[Luda] A a watch out watch out, boom
Call me the hit man, 'cuz I make you wanna call time-out
Then I make your mom cry-out, when I take your whole spine out
then watch me take ya, and fake ya, and shake ya, and break ya
and see you on hoooome to your maker
[Troy] You should give up now for talkin shit like that
But then you nothing, you garbage you betta' watch ya' back

[Chorus]

[Troy] (OK, OK now)
[Luda] I'm in that 2000 excursion
[Troy] Ridin on 22's, I hear da boom
[Luda] But booms just get more crunk
[Troy] It's the DSGB forever
[Luda] Ridin on pump
[Troy] I stunk, or did I say stunk, I meant stank (UN huh)
I think I'll take it please, or in another coffee break
you aint, but you can pretend to be homey
[Luda] I'm stiff arming these busters just as soon they get on me

[Chorus: repeat 2x]
