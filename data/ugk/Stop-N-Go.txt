UGK LYRICS




"Stop-N-Go"
(feat. Jazze Pha)



[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
We be pullin up in the hot shit and thats cuz we the stars of the show 
Now if you gettin money and got whips just pull up on your stop an go's 
This is the way we stop and go, don't block my way, we stop the show 

[Bun B:]
Please rise for the president of the south and all hale to the cheif with them diamond teeth in his mouth 
Make way! Big Dick Chaney is bout to enter 
king committees in session but first on the agenda 
Bend the corner on them fours lac turnin on them vouges 
1 time for the haters, 2 times for the hoes 
I suppose its only right for me to grip up on the cherry, oak wood wheel while im drippin cranberry 
and very few have acomplished what we have acheived without a rabbit out of a hat or a trick up his sleeve 
I got a steady hand and a steady flow so, on your mark get set, ready go, you already know......... 

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
We be pullin up in the hot shit and thats cuz we the stars of the show 
Now if you gettin money and got whips just pull up on your stop an go's 
This is the way we stop and go, don't block my way, we stop the show 

[Pimp C:]
Swishers and dank and pourin up big drank 
100 thousand dollars in my grown set link 
I got 2 on thats 200, you gone go crazy nigga tryna count my money 
I came from the bottom they hate me like im asadam 
198 in a spur house in nevada (vada vada) 
Vegas nigga got my paper pimpin thru cerwin vegas nigga 
Let me show you how we keep the parkin lot on fire, 
full kit on my shit 26 inch tiiiiiiiiiiiiires! 
Yokohamas an the wheel still wood, 
keep a bad yellow bitch cuz my dick feel good 
when you see us in the hood nigga...

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
We be pullin up in the hot shit and thats cuz we the stars of the show 
Now if you gettin money and got whips just pull up on your stop an go's 
This is the way we stop and go, don't block my way, we stop the show 

[Jazze Pha:]
Dope Man!! Ya and the dro in the drought 
pull up at the spot with the brains blowed out 
Wheels cost a whip, whip cost a house 
UGK and Jazze Pha show up and show out 
She wanna chill with the crew 
kick it in the crib on the hill with the view 
You know you wanna holla what it is? what it do? 
She love me for my old school drops an my cool 
cuz my shit be the truth whoa! 
The wheels never pause counterclock wise when i skirrrrrr on'em all. 
and when she fall thru an see the plaques on the wall 
she'll prolly call a couple friends! 
shit call'em all, down come the draws 

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
We be pullin up in the hot shit and thats cuz we the stars of the show 
Now if you gettin money and got whips just pull up on your stop an go's 
This is the way we stop and go, don't block my way, we stop the show
