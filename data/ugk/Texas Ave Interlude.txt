"Texas Ave Interlude"



[Bun B:]
PA is the town, where it's goin' down, West side to the East it's off the chain
I'm bangin' my surround, swangin' on these clowns, candy paint is drippin' leavin' stains
You see the diamonds grippin' on the grain, chrom-ed lady sittin' on the grill
Leanin' down the fifth, smokin' on the fif, drop the top and let em' see the trill
UGK 4 Life, you better ask your wife, she'll tell you Bun and Pimp the real
Light, back the knife so if you actin' schife then I'm a give you somethin' you can feel
Don't make me have to go and pull the steel
I cock it back and then I let it go
And put one in your dome, cause I be puttin' on, for my city better let it know
