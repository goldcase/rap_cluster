EAZY-E LYRICS




"Wut Would You Do"



Inside the minds of real g's
Death row is looked upon as the studio gangsters of the 90's
A joke hahahaha in a game called 5 minutes of fame you wasted
4 minutes now you got seconds left kick it

Come one come all and let me ride nigga
Eazy-e cpt how the hell you figure
To be the best on the west hu you?
Fool locked down this is east side nigga
South comton and I put it on the map
So when a dog pound crip you wanna scrap
And that coming straight from the ruthless gangster Eazy-e
Now what would I do ha ha let's see
Now I would take on sugars locked down the row
Since Dre is a bitch pimp slap the hoe
Now I'm seeing doubles man two dogs in a huddle
Aa god dame now diggidi daze I biggidi blast
On right one and smoke that ass
Now corrupt don't even set trip
Yelling long beach 60 blood and puppy pound
Crip really doe got my nuts on your chin
Well I'm all in your philly hoe
So come with it fool and test your luck and
I'll beat that ass now call me corrupt
Now I'm creeping through the fog you
Big dogg blue got my nine milla killa
Hunting a dogg named snoop
You can run nigga but you can't hide
Eazy-e straight creeping on the east side 7
Ten-long beach south caught snoop free basin
In a rock house I kicks in the door
I said it before I never let no busta test me no more
Bang murder was the case that they gave me
Murder was the case that they gave me

I'll smoke all you fools even you boo boo and your baby
Murder was the case that they gave me watch out buddie boy
Watch your back
Yeah what would you do?
What would you do if we rolled on you?
(so don't even think about stepping in the god damn house)
What would you do what would you do if we rolled on you?
What would you do what would you do if we rolled on you?
What would you do what would you do dirty red?

I comes on the snake hitting niggas low
With the cavey ass flow as I creep through the street
Peeping niggas from death row bet you wanna know
Which one make the best hoe so
Let me break it down as I'm lost in the mist
And take word of advice and don't come fucking with this
Ain't a joke niggas choke from the smoke that I blaze
Purple haze you be dazed in a stun
I'll put you on your back nigga what
I am the guess in a doggy dogg world
Never run with muss only nuts in their click
And dick in your mouth
The year is 95 and I'm running the house
Now tell what can you do nigga what can you do?
Nigga what could you do if me and a few of my homies came through?
Dumping real on you trick made bitch-made niggas
What could you do what could you do if we rolled on you?

you so don't even think about stepping in the god damn house
Dr. Dre straight busta never broke a law in his life
Besides beating up Ricky Harris's wife
Ha ha snoop dogg from a high top fade to sporting braids
Now he's laid fame no fortune and getting played not payed
Played
Treated like a prostitute and we all know who's doing the pimping that's don't
Be a follower be a leader and stay off the next man's nuts
Corrupt the king ping stick with the 60's
Cause you don't need those other hoes 'cause they're
About to go up in you but only you let um
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Death row really doe
Babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy bang ahhhh
