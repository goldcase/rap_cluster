"Make My Day"
(feat. Cee-Lo)



Ahh the sun is shining brighter cause you really make my day 
You really make my day 
Ohhh oh oh 
Yeah I think I like her cause she really makes my day 
Yeah she really makes my day 
Ohhh oh oh 

(ohhh oh oh) see her on the beach she was wrappped in a towel 
Her bodys going down see her ass crack to smile 
Enjoying the nile (woo) take it the breeze 
Or some cat a mouse 
And she was the cheese on the sun keys 
Yeah on a conversation 
California dreamin now california-cation 
Said she had drinks in the coller and I had an inventation if I wanted I could brewer this is just an invdication on 
How cool she was 
A couple of chicks came 
Groupie love 
They aint want no pictures 
Im think damn damn thats really cool because sometimes I wannta chill sometimes the best things in life are not even planned 
Came to the sand and got more than a tan 
Baby girl im a man 
And we can do this my way 
Take a ride on the highway and pretend that its friday 

Ahh the sun is shining brighter cause you really make my day 
You really make my day 
Ohhh oh oh 
Yeah I think I like her cause she really makes my day 
Yeah she really makes my day 
Ohhh oh oh 

(ohhh) she was at a bar-b-que 
Pretty painted nails she took off her shoes 
Grammer school 
Sippin on some l thinking man shes cool 
Sun smiling on her hair 
Playing spades and we can be a pair 
I love it when its sunny girl 
You could be my Cher
Inderpendence day and freedoms in the air 
Dance and danced away yo 
Showing steppin like a tango 
Like me, got me 
Sweet as icy spicy 
Drip from my lips 
We can do something hip 
Trip around the world in a day 
Play phonia a 

Ahh the sun is shining brighter cause you really make my day 
You really make my day 
Ohhh oh oh 
Yeah I think I like her cause she really makes my day 
Yeah she really makes my day 
Ohhh oh oh 

Ahh the sun is shining brighter cause you really make my day 
You really make my day 
Ohhh oh oh 
Yeah I think I like her cause she really makes my day 
Yeah she really makes my day 
Ohhh oh oh
