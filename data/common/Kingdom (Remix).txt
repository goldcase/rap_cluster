"Kingdom (Remix)"
(feat. Vince Staples, Jay Electronica)



Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom
Ooooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo-ooo-ooo-oooo-oooo-ooo-oooh
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom
Ooooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo-ooo-ooo-oooo-oooo-ooo-oooh
Ohh yes, my Lord, ahhh-ahh..AHH-ah-ah-ahhhhh
Ohh yes, my Lord, ahhh-ahh..AHH-ah-ah-ahhhhh

[Common:]
My money ain't straight, my fam ain't straight
Ain't wanna push keys, heaven couldn't wait
I was hurtin, couldn't get no work
You created me from dust, that's why I did dirt
You said that the last shall be first
Now I'm in a hearse, what's this cash really worth?
My whole life I had to worry about eatin
I ain't have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the kingdom for Chicago gon' come?
I'm comin back like the Prodigal Son, and I got a son
And I don't want my ways followin him, the streets swallowin him
And I don't want no hollows in him
His momma said she see his father in him, hope it's the good thing
'Til life was over is when I understood things
Standin at the gates cause I know you've forgiven what I've done
I'm your son, do I have the keys to get in?

[Chorus:]
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (Yeah)
Ooooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo-ooo-ooo-oooo-oooo-ooo-oooh (Sing)
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (Yeah)
Ooooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo-ooo-ooo-oooo-oooo-ooo-oooh
(And the streets say) Ohh yes
(And the people say)  My Lord
(And we all say) Ahhh-ahh..AHH-ah-ah-ahhhhh
(And the streets say) Ohh yes
(And the people say)  My Lord
(And we all say) Ahhh-ahh..AHH-ah-ah-ahhhhh

[Vince Staples:]
Sweet Lord Jesus, tell the polices
to let a nigga breathe, my sinnin father see
got a shipment by the seas, see my niggaz tryna eat
Eat whatever's on your plate, save some for me
The worst things in life come sittin six feet
Tryna hop the gate to heaven cause I couldn't get a key
But these niggaz play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back cause these stripes ain't free
We, still wadin in the water
Cocaine, blunts, marinating in the water
Lean and took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I can play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell 'em talk is cheap, niggaz livin for the dollar
So in God we trust, leave the prayin to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control, just walk in my soles
Roll, lit up with the abuse
They wasnâ€™t for show, I promise every pistol was used
See I was wakin up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day, bare-faced, givin niggaz the blues
Nigga, who you? They know me on the streets where I grew
If you ain't from 'round here, you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for the keys to the kingdom...

[Chorus]

[Jay Electronica:]
Nas hit me up on the phone like
"Peace, Isa, you know you need to preach
how the pyramids of Giza alone condemn Easter
Instead of sniffin lines, poppin thongs in Ibetha
Ether - nigga, are we not thy brother's keeper?"
Allah u Akbar, ah-bracadabra
We used what we had to stay alive like MacGyver
(Started From the Bottom), now we really really here
Started kinda blurry, now we really really clear
It's the Nat King (Unforgettable), black king on a pedestal
The way he made words into edibles was incredible
Verbs and spices, givin life out to the lifeless
Givin Christ out to the Christless, my handle with the dice
has been documented as priceless, I roll 7's naturally
Devils who used to laugh at me bow to me internationally
Rappers I gave birth to shot at the God - blasphemy
Told these motherfuckers they'll never Jimmy DeGrassi me
This goes out to those that choose to use
Disrespectful views on original Jews
The chosen people of God gettin slandered and abused
In the streets, and the news by the seed of Yakub
The synagogues of Satan wanna keep us confused
That's how we lose, niggaz got the Ill street blues
From Chi-Raq to England, me and Common droppin bombs
like the baby planes as we establish the kingdom

(And the streets say) Ohh yes
(And the people say)  My Lord
(And we all say) Ahhh-ahh..AHH-ah-ah-ahhhhh
