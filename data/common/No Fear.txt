"No Fear"



[Verse 1:]
Sitting on stairs, in street affairs
Jordan Airs, he got at least seven pairs
His voice rare, talk with a mumble
Chicago Bearhead, caught up at the huddle
Call an audible of trouble came
His name Chris, black as his hustle name
Raction to his chains, it's like a basketball game
Watch him winning, hope your team do the same
A menace, he O-Dog, Caine
Wish a nigga would go against his grain
Used to staying but moved up in the game
Take a nigga spot, take a nigga fame
The fortune of a caine, long live his reign
He do it for a son, he do it with a gun
Whatever he do, yo, he do it till it's done
A team full of hitters, so they hit and run
The prestone even want none
Walk with the G's cause the G's never run
Something to be from the slum and be the one
This is where he at, this is where he from

[Hook:]
Where I'm from [x16]

[Verse 2:]
Living life with no fear
Putting that truth in my baby girl's ear
Told her that dudes gon' want some ass
And whatever you do, do it with class
She wanna E, but to me, you gotta earn it
You can't circumvent life, you gotta earn it
It's the circle of life, that's why we're turning
Yo, I hit a choir and a sermon, our messiah is returning
With a tile around my neck, a style around respect
Know the smell of good pussy and the sound of a tec
They fire, drill, stop dropping roll
I popped out the cold hip-hop, that was gold
The way of the road is our ode to the legacy
C'mon dog, you know my pedigree
Find it forever be, the sun never set on me
Many reign, but the game never weather me
If I'm in the building that mean I got equity
Where articles are black like Ebony
Since I was a shorty I was thinking long charity
No fear, I say that with levity

[Hook]
