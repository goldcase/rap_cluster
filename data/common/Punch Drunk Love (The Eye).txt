"Punch Drunk Love (The Eye)"
(feat. Kanye West)



Come on Come on Come on Come one 
Come on girl lets Goooo 

[Chorus - Kanye West]
Hey baby 
Am I crazy 
Or was u giving me the eye (the eye) 
You said maybe (yea) 
Well you crazy 
Because I know I'm too fly 
I already know im too fly (too fly) [X3]
Yeah I know what cha like. 

[Common]
Like now I'm off the wine (wine) 
And we can take our time (time) 
So much I want to I wants to fronts spilled the bump when we grind 
My uh in is ya body 
My uh is in ya mind 
Check my dictionary 
That ass is so divine 
It slippery when its wet girl 
I can read the signs 
I knocked and I knocked (uh) can I come inside 
I knocked and I knocked girl can I come inside 
I feel like its home when I'm in between ya thighs 
It's the joy, and the pain, and the bites and the brain 
What make it feel so good 
That type of stuff u cant explain 
I do what I do to do to make it rain 
U got the invite tonight 
And I'm so glad ya came 
Cuz you the type that danger we gain in yo 
Mic check like the way I begin my show 
Girl I come from chi-ca-so N I go 
Turn around its about to be a TKO 

[Chorus]

Some call me COM (COM) 
Some call me the red (RED) 
U can call me daddy, I'ma put ya to bed 
An appetite for seduction 
And it gotta be fed 
Her sexual eruption got ya hitting ya head 
On the board 
And knock and screaming, oh lord 
We exchange like students cuz I student abroad 
And listen to ya body and low key partin' 
And I keep pushing and pushing 
U bout to volley em' up 
We the type to make lovin and we up 
We take a ride down south cuz u need to re-up 
Girl u call me big bank like I was saving it up 
I'm the doctor I can hold it till my patients is up 

I make, I make I make it hot baby 
I know I know I know just stop baby 

When we do it like we don't want it to end 
Its 3 PM we gon do it again. 

[Chorus]

[X2]
Come on girl lets go 
To distant lands unknown 
We can fly on air 
If love is everywhere, 
For you and me 

[Chorus]
