"Everywhere"



[Chorus]
How did you know I been waiting for this time to come
And though it tastes like for ever it may not stay long…
Everywhere it’s summer [repeat 4X]

[Verse 1]
A shaman since before my birth
And I came down to rock the earth
My mission condition:
I give you, you listen
Im syncing in time in parallel
In binary, no 3rd return
Im planning intention
With love the redemption

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
No pop, no pop, no pop, no pop
We gon do this thang till the sky just drop
Lock into you mind away we rock
In a rocket is the 87th astronaut
Top of the soul, dove and I got in a hole
At the moment they were sayin
It was outa control
Strap into your mind 
Why eyes see some recline
You’ll see in time your season to shine
When the stadium is dark
MC’s are defined
Get ready, on your mark, put your feet on the line
The race is on, to space beyond
You gon get there by doin what you want
Sometimes the most famous feel all alone
So we trip to a place that we call our home
I was known as being spaced and outa my dome
now I know, it all I’ve known

[Chorus]
