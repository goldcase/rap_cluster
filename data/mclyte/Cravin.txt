"Cravin'"



Ho! Ohhhh Oh Yeah Yeah!

I wanna know, I'm done waitin
There's a passion in the air that I'm cravin
And I can't hold out don't wanna hold back
I can't hold out for you
I can't hold out don't wanna hold back
I can't hold out for you

Uh! Time to live life, make it amazin
Been cravin since the days of Days Inn
Now I'm at the Four Seasons, I got a reason
To celebrate, somethin to believe in (Come on now!)
Great time great minds think alike
You ain't for doin it right, then get a life
What time in this game means it's bittersweet
But even my enemies know I'm the centerpiece

I wanna know, I'm done waitin
There's a passion in the air that I'm cravin
And I can't hold out don't wanna hold back
I can't hold out for you
I can't hold out don't wanna hold back
I can't hold out for you

No more waitin, time to post up
Somebody yell action time for close ups
Ready for blast off dudes take your hats off
Respect diamonds on my neck now that's boss!
Good livin never hurt nobody
Ladies grab your honey, fellas grab your hottie
Let's make it a moment that we'll never forget
Like nothin ever will be better than this

I wanna know, I'm done waitin
There's a passion in the air that I'm cravin
And I can't hold out don't wanna hold back
I can't hold out for you
I can't hold out don't wanna hold back
I can't hold out for you

Na Na Na Na! Na Na Na Na! 
Na Na Na Na! Na Na Na Na! 
Na Na Na Na! Na Na Na Na! 
Na Na Na Na! Na Na Na Na! 

Let's go! Hands up if you know that your feelin the vibe
Hands up if you know we 'gon get it tonight
('Cause we 'gon party, like nobody)
Hands up if you really 'bout gettin your cream
Hands up in you interest in reachin your dreams
It's like yeah! Keep 'em in the air!
It's bout to go down and we 'bout to take you THERRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEE!!!!!!!

I wanna know, I'm done waitin
There's a passion in the air that I'm cravin
And I can't hold out don't wanna hold back
I can't hold out for you
I can't hold out don't wanna hold back
I can't hold out for you

Na Na Na Na! Na Na Na Na! 
Na Na Na Na! Na Na Na Na! 
Na Na Na Na! Na Na Na Na! 
Na Na Na Na! Na Na Na Na!
