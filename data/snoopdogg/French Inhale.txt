SNOOP DOGG LYRICS




"French Inhale"
(with Wiz Khalifa)
(feat. Mike Posner)



[Chorus - Mike Posner]
French Inhale, I like the way you French Inhale
Do it Again
French Inhale, I like the way you French Inhale
Do it Again

[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa]
You don’t gotta sell it, cuz its already sold
And you don’t gotta roll one cuz its already rolled
Check out my technique, just weed let it fold
Shit I’ve been smokin’ since I was 14 years old
I had a dime who never smoked blunts just bowls
Taught me how to blow O’s, inhale threw my nose
So if you see me smoking ‘ blow my high
Uh, so I roll one and we both gonna fly
You smell it all in my clothes
I'm taking in all the smoke when I…

[Chorus - Mike Posner]
French Inhale, I like the way you French Inhale
Do it Again
French Inhale, I like the way you French Inhale
Do it Again

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
I take it to the face, inhale it threw my nose
Blowin’ with the homies on the low, man fuck these hoes!
It crackalack, peel it back
Whatcha call that mack who crack a bad bitch like that?
A cracker jack!
I'm like a florist, touring like a tourist
Godzilla flying on a pegasaurus
Niggas know about it, even ‘fore I pull it out
I put some fire on it, and now there beggin me to put it out
I’m in the hallway rolling on the purple syke
I know the in’s and out’s so I’mma do what the fuck I like

[Chorus - Mike Posner]
French Inhale, I like the way you French Inhale
Do it Again
French Inhale, I like the way you French Inhale
Do it Again
