LUPE FIASCO LYRICS




"Next To It"
(feat. Ty Dolla $ign)



[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Let’s do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Let’s do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Let’s do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Let’s do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Money ain’t shit when there’s wealth next to it
Wealth ain’t shit when there’s health next to it
In the lane with nobody else next to it
Ain’t get here by myself, lot of help next to it
Word to chilly chill, that’s myself let’s do it
1st and 15 ent, F&L music
Out in 05, ain’t nothing let’s do it
Don’t say my name, unless my city next to it

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Anything look good with a bitch next to it
And if the bitch got a face that’s pretty next to it
Riding around town something really exclusive
Bump a little Pac with some Biggie next to it
That’s love with a twist next to it
That’s a blood with a crip next to it
At the Bulls game like a tree gift next to it
Yes, that’s the flow and I sit next to it

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]

[Bridge: Ty$]
Everybody look better with a chick, let’s do it
Rollie with a wrist next to it
Top down on a whip that’s roofless
Let’s do it
Club ain’t turned less some womens into it
It’s the chicks that do it

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Crib ain’t shit ‘less a whip next to it
Whip ain’t shit ‘less Benz next to it
But a Benz ain’t shit with a Rari next to it
Rari ain’t shit with a Zonda next to it
Really tell a difference when a Honda next to it
But a Honda is shit when you jogging next to it
‘Cause this a baby momma with a condom next to it
‘Cause this a miracle I’m still rockin’ let’s do it
Still need a comma with a zero next to it
Then another comma with a zero next to it
Then a zero next to it and a zero next to it
Then another fuckin’ comma then a zero next to it
What we talkin’ that’s a million, let’s do it
What we talkin’ that’s a million, let’s do it
Still at the bottom with a million next to it
‘Cause a million ain’t shit with a billion next to it
