"Mean & Vicious"



[Verse 1:]
Uuhhh
He's meannnnnn
And vicious
I can't believe he's that rude
To those stories those rhymes that jew
Then he put 'em on the floor like cat food (meow)
And put 'em on the track like glue
Then put 'em on your head like hat
Hey back to you Lu black power
I'm just running with a barrel full of black powder
With a hole in it hole in it wheezin deep, breathing
Running from the fire on the trail I keep leaving
I can't shake it I swear it's heat seeking
I keep seeking somewhere to hide from it I can die from it
But it keep keeping up just when I think that I've done it
It keep sneakin up
Ohh leaking barrel of black powder how that flame keep reaching us
Just one of the long rended extended metaphors a lose
This time I use an example of a fuse
To demonstrate how I can't lose
I would put it down but I can't due to the glue
That I use the fuse everything together
Well I spill some on my hands
And God Damn I might have to carry this forever
Well I'm crazy to the game till they bury me insane

[Chorus:]
There once was a boy that grew up on the west side of chicago
Liked his hat to the left side
Wasn't in a gang but he was prone to bang
Doing his thanngg doin his thang
There once was a boy that grew up on the west side of chicago
Liked his hat to the left side
Wasn't in a gang but he was known to bang (uuhh) like
Doing his thanngg (yeah) doin his thang

[Verse 2:]
Truthfully I have trouble with second verses
Cause the first one be so intimidating
It'd be bullying and picking on it instigating
Pointing out all the second ones limitations
Like you ain't nothing but an imitation
Like betcha baking then it gets the chorus
And the beat to together then they gang up on him and get to hating
But then around the 8th bar he tired
So they conspire and comiserating then he find his inspiration
To spar he takes a few seconds of judo lessons
Gets back on beat then punches the guitar
They stand in awe like when did you write that
They even right black
First verse already happened
So he don't have a chance to fight back
I like that
Abagnale Junior check me
You gonna respect me
A 8 track listen to em feelin himself
Swagger up and a few ad libs to back it up
Let's back it up
I think you've had enough
Give me my mic back
You ain't even write that
Oh it's like that
Track stop pumping till this nigga stop fronting
Yeah yeah now right back
