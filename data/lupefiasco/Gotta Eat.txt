"Gotta Eat"



[Intro]
I swear when I see this nigga, I'ma kill em, I'm going to kill him, so make niggas suffer.

[Chorus]
My man said life aint easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy streets be all
Like feed me feed me when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy (x2)
My man said life aint easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy

[Verse 1]
Hey he had a whole lot of cheese plus he was a mac had a whole lot of steez
Made a lot of niggas fat gave a whole lot of G's, grams man he had a whole lot of these
And he would let you hold a whole lot of keys, even if u lose some he would give you new ones
Twice the bread like he had two buns, and he had a whole lot of steez even his kids had meals
For reals some rich small fries wrapped in paper since they was little, ketchup nigga

[Chorus]
My man said life ain't easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy streets be all
Like feed me feed me when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy
My man said life aint easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy

[Verse 2]
He was a heart breaker and a large shaker, if it was bout caking, he was a part taker
International he would take trips bon voyage just as hard he was fishing for the chips so greedy
Never gave to the needy thats what some say he shoned on the bums hanging in the subways he
Called them fruits and laughed at em delivery man on the pick up drive through and throw the bag
At em it was hard to understand him sometimes making a killing the way he had em standing in line
Like

[Chorus]
My man said life aint easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy streets be all
Like feed me feed me when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy
My man said life aint easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy

[Verse 3]
Lovers call him king haters call him clown he would say bite me thats the way its goin down he
Was having thoughts that maybe he should retire went to church on sunday and saw a deep fryer said
He had beef and people want him dead he love the hungry ones only scared of the feds he lived
The fast life couldn't get his path right fried just told him bout the hooters that he had last
Night turn yourself in to the patty wagon said no bacon wouldn't take em had the pigs on the pay
Roll

[Outro]
To be continued, on another menu, ya dig.
Will he give up his life of crime or will he stay?
This and other adventured on lupe fiasco's next album, L - U - P - END

Yessir!

My man said life ain't easy when niggas gotta eat thats when shit get greasy, hey!
