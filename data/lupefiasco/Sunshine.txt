"Sunshine" lyrics






LUPE FIASCO LYRICS




"Sunshine"



Uh, Fresh to def she is
From her steps to the set she is
So "death" might not let me live
Ya dig
Fresh uh huh, yes she is
Had a feeling that it would be a day like this
The orchestra in my mind don't play like this (naw),
But I'm prepared for it
Got a lil rare for it
Brushed off my airs
Even cut my hair for it
'Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be looking for like, like that
Then there go it
Yea right over there so I prepare the poet
Lil scared my stair lowered
Momma said have no fear
Plus I'm already outta my chair
Gathered up my airs on my square from here forward
It's nothing right so here go it
Whisper in her ear "it's kinda crowded in here"
Would she care to blow it she said "yea"

[chorus]
You're my sunshine (you're my sunshine),
You're my moonlight (you're my moonlight),
You're the starry skies above me won't you please come down and hug me,
Think I found love in this club tonight (Wowowowo)

Never met her before
But I think I like her like a metaphor
It's hard to get in the car we sit
From the intro she rolled down her window just in case I was a skitzo
I compliment her on the common sense
I'm calm
A lil more confident (Uh Huh)
And then we lose consciousness
She says "that I've been waiting for you"
And I know you've been chasing me too since they kidnapped me from a castle
I been thinking of you
I told her "fire breathing dragon he bet not harm me" or he be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor yes you be
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said "see, too beautiful to let you sleep"

[chorus]

Relationship is just 30 minutes long
It's kinda heavy maybe a lil strong
Gonna take much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two before I bid you a due
Do this one thing for me outta the trillions of numbers that's in the world
Just leave me a few that lead to you
Won't be longing I see you in the morning

[chorus]
