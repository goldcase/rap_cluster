E-40 LYRICS




"Episode"
(feat. T.I. & Chris Brown)



[Hook: Chris Brown]
All my little bad bitches in here
If you came to get ratchet, say "yeah"
Baby, touch your toes
We can get freaky, have an episode
Tell me is ya with that
Episode, tell me is ya with that

[Verse 1: E-40]
I don't like it, I love it, I wanna grip it and touch it
I'm tryna hit it and fuck it, stab it and stick it and stuck it
Get you to lick it and suck it and kiss it after I nutted
We can be friends, ain't gotta be seen in the public
I'm about that verb, that action, have that coochie having contractions
When I be smashing and smacking and sapping, thrusting and thrashing
Sit back and relax and have a glass of this bottle
Earl Stevens selections: mango moscato
Handbag by Selena, seem like I already knew ya
Beautiful girl, you so bad, look like somebody done drew ya
My eyes salute ya, you a sight for sore eyes, booty and thighs
You and yo' girls should get with me and my guys
Come and get a bar of this mackin', baby girl, get rid of that sap
He ain't real, he a fraud, baby girl, that dude is a cat!
When he first intervened, he bought you flowers, no doubt
But once he got in good, he started doggin' you out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Shawty in love with them gangstas, that's why she holla at me
A country nigga, we whipping up 50 thousand a ki'
You just be giving her, getting her, I just fill her with D
Even though she cute and petite, freaky, discreet
She got extensions of booty with them tattoos on her cheek
Make me wanna take her to a island, we could do it for weeks
Girl, let me Birkin your bag, Jimmy Choo on your feet
Let me get you out of the Jag and in that Bentley GT
I'm on the west coast, droptop riding, fool
With E-40 sitting with me, we riding, fool
Hustle Gang bang green, we tried thems truths
Somebody told you otherwise, they lied to you
I bet it all, roll the dice, bet, bet
Quarter mil' on me in the bag, check that
Them suckas don't like it but they gon' respect that
Spend the night, have a episode, you won't forget that, check that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Girl, I came here with all my niggas and all this liquor
Said she want a threesome, I'm gon' lick her
From the bottom to the top, take it down
I'mma roll the weed but she gon' break it down
It's not my fault if that's yo' girl
Cause she wanna leave with a real nigga
Pussy on my balls, her panties in my car
Before your nigga call, you know I gotta get it

[Hook]
