"I'm On One"



(You’re on/ You’re on/ You’re on/ You’re on)

[Chorus:]
I’m on: One, One, One, One, One [4X]

I’m on like a pot/ I cook up
I got the hook up
A slap makes the demons look up
I got em’ shook up
...
Yayo college is what I took up
Northern cali fo ya my nizzle
put up or shut up

Homeboy loaded like a shot gun
Smokin’ like a chimney
Higher
than the trees in Yosemite
Twisted like a pretzel
Drinkin cranberry and cognac
Stay afloat keep my head above sea level

So much hate in my region
So much stress in my brain
Hey a rapper ain’t eatin’
So he needs someone to blame

So they blame it on ya boy
Cause I got the biggest mouth
Light it up and have a chain
See the soul train

Step your bar game up
Practice your penmanship
Stop the claiming and making excuses
Nigga make a hit

Just the other day I heard a fuck nigga say
Funny y’all with him but Vallejo ain’t in the bay
I said that’s some hard shit a nigga like you would say
Cause’ it’s haters like your washed up ass that’s in the way

Ugh. Tycoon diamonds
glimmin like the sun
I’m in a fucked up mood
And a nigga on one

[Chorus]

Smokin’ on smelly
Yappin on my celly

Hustlin’
Getting’ Money is a habit
Always getting dusty
Always in the traffic

Out of town out of state
Doing shows makin’ cake

Spitin
