"Turn It Up"



[C Ballin]
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch

[E-40]
I got no time for no silly games
I'm out here in this trap trying have my change
I fuck with real bosses, I don't fuck with lames
Califor-n-i-a is the state I claim
Bitches on my ankle like a ankle bracelet
Cuz I'm relevant and I ain't outdated
Suckers looking at me like they wana fade
They fuck around they gona get emlimate
Bossy, flossy, fetty stretchy like pilates
Got a black belt hustlin, not karate
The best thing sense the slot machine
She a dime spitter, a couple of lines and that bitch is mines
Now I don't know what you been thinking
But I've been the shit in my region
Ever sense I can remember
Ever sense I been breathing
Hollin at a vixen, plotin on some kitten
When I start spittin, she starts strippin

[C Ballin]
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch

[E-40]
I passionate about my paper man
I ain't got time for games
The child shit ain't in my program man
I mean it to you all lanes
I'm bossy, once I get started its hard to stop me man I go
Lieutenant rosta boss I ain't Captain save a ho
I let a bitch know I got no ho, bitch I'm poo
You gata dig me for me, that's the way it's gona go
I be galaxy man, I be spacin
When I'm spacin I mean my space be in flight and a ho as nigga tryin test my patience
Colt 45 case, and I ain't talkin about the beer
I talkin street instrumentals, music to my ears
I ain't no petty nigga with a face tat and a six pack
But I bet I could beat your bitches couchie back
Skinny niggas winning right now
When the big nigga come back in style
Bitch

[C Ballin]
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch

[E-40]
You call it swag
I call it stylin
You nutin to me
I nutin to nothing
I could be broker then you
But I got more respect and more power
Right now I sell CD's
But I used to slang powder
I ain't gata have no paper to get me skin
I just give had her my phone and she punch her number in
Mack game
Big boss talk
I don't make it rain
And I don't pay for yoak
You see the big face Rolex watch
The VS1 clarity watch
The jacket made out of fox
You know how much that cost
The three dimensional diamond
More carrots then bugs bunny
Taylor made and hand crafted like
Customize like King Johnny
Some times I like to spoil myself
All that hatin ain't nutritious
Its bad for your health
What about murder mouthin
Talk down on a boss
Through that nigga a towel
He been dipped in sucker sauce

[C Ballin]
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
I turn it up on a bitch
