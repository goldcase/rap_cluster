[Verse 1:]
Champion beanie and beanie cap
D-Boy a tile
Every promoter and partner got my name on their flyer
I'm on this bubba kush right higher than a hiker
My folks fresh back from the mountains and he got that fire
Feelin' good like you should liquor in my cup
Understood I'm in the hood like a ice cream truck
You should spend with my I'll hook you up, cause I could give you more bang for your buck
Poor politics, poverty, puzzler pieces pertaining, paper preceding profit pocket, prydein prosperous promise, putting bees in your pocket, proofing the put, you
Probably you can but you probably shouldn't.
Alain Silberstein collection watch botch, don't ask me how much this muthafucker cost
You steppin' over dollars for pennies, I'm steppin' over pennies for dollars, you dealing with hoes and they periods, I'm dealing with hustlers and convicts (Bitch!)

[Verse 2:]
My Camaro souped up, and I ain't talking bout Campbell's
Speakers in the grill and in the door panels
Detachable steering wheel case they try and steal' light you up like a candle with my Springfield
Rifle for rifle, built for survival, it's wild, and homo-sidle out here in the bay, with 90's and SK's, we living the last days, they calling the wrong plays, rolling over in their graves ancestors used to be slaves
I try to trust saved folks, love em' to death, but they be the ones that stir up the most mess, I ask em how they doin and they holler out player, pack an air gun like their better than the next
I'm the rawest in it, I say the realest shit
Keep the sickest flow, I ain't quit
I started this independent shit so I'm a finish it, been in it forever, for a grip, for a minute. (BITCH!)

E-40 [x10]
What's My Muthafuckin Name!
E-40 [x10]
So tell me where to go like my name E-40
What's My Muthafuckin Name!
E-40 [x7]
What's My Muthafucking Name!
E-40 [x4]
So tell me where to go like my name E-40
What's My Muthafucking Name!

Bars like a restaurant, I don't drink to drink I drink to get drunk
I might eat the pink after I hit the blunt, dick on hard like a penis pump
Carbs, she got a big donk, not the donk with slump, but the donk I wanna hump, the type that's thick and plump with junk in her trunk, hit it from the back and then the front
The function was bamicro, we got it crackin'
Shit was so quite you could a spider piss on a napkin
Packers on a diet, hell na mayne we stackin'
Seemed like a riot the way the music had use actin' (BITCH!)

E-40 [x10]
What's My Muthafuckin Name!
E-40 [x10]
So tell me where to go like my name E-40
What's My Muthafuckin Name!
E-40 [x7]
What's My Muthafucking Name!
E-40 [x4]
So tell me where to go like my name E-40
What's My Muthafucking Name!
