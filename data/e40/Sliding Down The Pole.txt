(feat. Too $hort)



[Chorus:]
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is

Uh huh

[Verse 1:]
They she her brain is in her ass but she really smart
All about her cash never been a mark
Raise in the trap seen a whole lot
Glutious maximums shape like a heart
Legs spread apart
Trying to go to Clark
Looking for the light
But always find dark
Some of my folks like trickin
Some of my folks like pimpin
Some of my folks spit rap
Some of my folks pitch crack
Give you a tycoon shower
Without the shower cap
I got the money and the power
Sprinkle you a stack
There she go sliding down the pole
One dollar bills coming out her asshole

[Chorus:]
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is
There she is
There she go
There she go
There she is
There she is
There she go
There she go
Wow
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is
Yeah
There she go
Uh huh
There she is
Yeah
There she go
Uh huh
Wow

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
There she go
Down the pole
That's daddy's little girl
But he don't know
If he finds out she'll be in trouble
But if he don't her money doubles
Everyday she goes to work
Put her on stage they go berserk
I'm way in the back blowing purp
You throwing cash in the air
You suppose to flirt
She come out dem draws ass everywhere
Don't keep her all night
Pass her player
Cause she's my favorite yes she is
I wanna see her dance naked
She the best in the biz
Bitch!

[Chorus:]
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is
There she is
There she go
There she go
There she is
There she is
There she go
There she go
Wow
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is
Yeah
There she go
Uh huh
There she is
Yeah
There she go
Uh huh
Wow

[Verse 3: E-40]
Bigger than all outdoors
She got booty galore
Ass like I've never seen before
She cakey
She pickin up her money off the floor
It's crazy all the ballers in the club know
I called the crib told my broad I ain't coming back home
I den found another chick I wanna bone

[Verse 4: Too $hort]
They call me short
I'm nothing nice
Been hangin out in clubs all my life
Seen a wild ass stripper
Hair was bushy
Upside down with a bear in her pussy
Lay up on the pole she can sit on a roof
Slid back down she was getting it loose

[Chorus]

There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole

[Chorus:]
There she is
There she is
There she go
There she go
There she is
There she is
There she go
There she go
Wow
There she go sliding down the pole
There she go sliding down the pole
There she is
Yeah
There she go
Uh huh
There she is
Yeah
There she go
Uh huh
Wow
