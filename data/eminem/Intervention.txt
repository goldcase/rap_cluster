"Intervention" lyrics






EMINEM LYRICS




"Intervention"
(with Linkin Park)



[Chester:]
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus:]
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

[Chester:]
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds.
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down.

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

[Chorus:]
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

[Mike:]
You told me, "Yes"
You held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring
You lost that right, to hold that crown
I built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

[Eminem:]
Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
To seize the moment and don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.
No wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders.)
Yoda-loda-le-hee-hoo
I think it went wandering off down yonder
And stumbled on 'ta Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

[Chester:]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus:]
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

[Mike:]
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

[Chester:]
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

[Mike:]
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

[Chester:]
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground
