"show you how"
catch up, niggas
damn you fadin' hov, how you gave 'em that?
audemars-piguet, with the alligator strap
sick of y'all niggaz with ya now or later raps
rap about it now, hope you get it later
do a couple shows, hope you niggas is savin' up
i'll show you how to do this son
this particular watch be a one of one
that means none before it, none to come
the homie that's rappin' be the only one that has it
i'll show you how to do this son
you ain't heard? i push the sixes when the fives is out
you can't fight me, in the porsche i'll box you out
i'll show you how to do this son
we don't drive x5's we give 'em to baby-mammas
push the big top that shake like the kansas chicken snackboxx
i get it crackin' when i'm backing out the garage
a 360 drop farage, shutdown manhattan
bucket low, like fuck it, though
nights on, daytime, lights on, hell yeah i'm frontin' but you love it, though
i'll show you how to do this son
nigga i'm a check writer your royalty recievers
y'all eaten off per diem, on the low like a cesar
pay ya taxes, you niggaz is husttlin' backwards
i cop and crash whips, jay is a bastard
i'll show you how to do this son
how you want it, my jeans is 300
this ain't diesel, nigga, these is evisu
top is rock, you know the rest
a big bucket of frozen water on my chest
i'll show you how to do this son
get a crate, some crack, and some house slippers
a newspaper, look out boy, and get ya chips up
or get a gun, a mask an escape route
some ducktape'll make 'em take you to the house
and ma don't give him nothin', unless he treatin' you special
soon he'll get desperate, and go down and bless you
and when he come up for air, with a mouth full of hair
just grab your coach bag and get the fuck outta there, yeah
i'll show you how to do this hon
look, think big, fuck getting your nails done
think cars, cribs, jewels, some shit for your son
don't let 'em give you, hard dick and bubble gum
make him cop the lex bubble, 2001 hon
i'll show you how to do this hon
and if your man got you bagging up, it could be worse
just put a little in the baggy, put a little in the purse
