"dig a hole"
(feat. sterling simms)
uh
dig a whole burry yourself niggah
go ahead, keep goin i got some nice dresses for you guys over there
the incomparable h.o.
uh
yesss
what you see now?
came, conquered
we g'on see now
dig a hole
go 'head
motherfucker, burry yourself
dig a hole
dig a hole
dig a hole
i'm still hear mon frerre
you know the cost i bear
like, thats why they call you hov, i'm like yeah
like air
little shots go through me, wont tear one tissue
no tears no tissue, not an issue
dont cry for me i peep these niggahz from deep
by the front row seat even if you dont speak
silent pardon, i hear you loud and clear
you left your fingure print, you aint gotta be there
i'm just waitin 'till you dig a hole big enough to put your whole body in
then i'm gon' body them
it's nothing but a hobby to him
simple as serve and volley to him
niggahz like "hov why dont you get at ol' boy"
why kill a puppet and leave cheppetto alive (from pinocio)
why not wait till you get em all together, thats when you dig one big hole, one time
what you see now?
we gon' see clown
dig a hole
dig a hole
go 'head, burry yourself
dig a hole
dig a hole
go 'head
hows niggahs dissin me? i made it possible
for niggahs to make history, how is the possible?
please explain this shit to me, how is it logical?
have we forgot our history? lets open our bibles
its like the disciples dissing jesus becoming his rivals
shunning teh one thing that they owe their life to
you let that man hype you to go against your idol
knowing good and god damn well this what i do
think i'm in the office i lost my grind
thats how kids become orphans, you lost your mind!?
i keep my enemies close
i give 'em enough rope
they put themselves in the air
i just kick away the chair
uh
uh
we gon' see now
uh huh
we gon' see clown
dig a hole
dig a hole
go 'head, burry yourself
dig a hole
dig a hole
go 'head, burry yourself
hov gon' get you, i aint forget your little disrespect
no hov, daddy gon' spank your for that shit you said
it's hard to do, when you got nothin to prove
everbody know you better, you in a lose lose
even if you win, ultimately you lose
real niggahz like, "why hov talkin to dude"
he's sellin low too
only time you went plat
my chain was around yout neck, thats an actual fact
so i'm praying that it spills outside of the booth
thats when y'all niggahz outside of your truth
outside of your league, thats not what you do
niggahz throwing roc signs outside of your coupe
dun look at hove like he dun somethin wrong to em
he just took what belong to em
niggahz playing checkers wid chess playing hov
this game is over i dunno if y'all know
you in a hole
we gon' see now
uh huh
we gon' see clown
dig a hole
dig a hole
go 'head, burry yourself
dig a hole
dig a hole
go 'head, burry yourself
