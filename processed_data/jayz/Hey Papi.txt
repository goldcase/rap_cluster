(feat. amil, memphis bleek, timbaland)

(yeah, yeah, uh, uh, uh yeah-yea-yeah, yeah-yea-yeah)
(come on)
i said all my mamis bounce
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
freaky-freaky...
ay yo i got a resolution
this year i'm playing right
no six fifteen this year
you can stay the night
we can go bowling it ain't like before
can't y'all see that i'm growing?
i was so immature
i was young and having money
having honeys come to the crib
thinkin' they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me
some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge
i went to one trump plaza on their asses'
no room service just snacks and shit
work with those lil' debbies and when your done get ready
the chicks i was fiendin' to smash
let 'em lean on the cash
will take 'em on long trips
break 'em with long dick
there was no such thing as strong relationships
but i'm off that playa shit
i need a chick that practice tai chi
that still can buy weed
and can give me some good head
and i'll make her remind me, uh-huh
(hey papi)
even if they don't understand the flow
they understand the dough
my ladies going
(hey papi)
promise you'll never let me go
promise you'll never leave me
promise we'll grow, they going
(hey papi)
even if they don't understand the flow
they understand the dough
the ladies going
(hey papi)
promise you'll never let me go
promise you'll never leave me
promise we'll grow, they saying
yo, yo, yo, yo the only thing bleek spinning is
them chrome wheels spinning on them new rims
home suspended from school again
i'm grown, still ill ladies love to be a deal, like bleek
can i feel up on your wood and grill?
it's a hood thing, wood grain, off the chain
she give me good brain
love the way i push my slang
callin' my jack soon as the hop in my v
they catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave
bet'cha man can't do it like this, like this
i bet his wrists ain't bluish like this, like this
and i'm from marcy you catch me on anybody's block
rappin' thug, the roc
hoes they all clock like
(hey papi)
even if they don't understand the flow
they understand the dough
my ladies going
(hey papi)
promise you'll never let me go
promise you'll never leave me
promise we'll grow, they saying
(hey papi)
even if they don't understand the flow
they understand the dough
the ladies going
(hey papi)
promise you'll never let me go
promise you'll never leave me
promise we'll grow, they saying
i was the worse
i used to switch chicks every day
had niggas mad for real like "i wish he was gay"
cause they knew sooner or later hun was gettin' with jay
just a matter of time she was gettin' with jay
i'll have your chick in the summer tropics sippin' on 'zae
spittin' up in the pacifics smoking spliffs in the shade
she used to love ya, but she feeling different today
you used to smother her, look at your honey slippin' away
consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space
she said she feel free when she's around me
i'm letting her do her and in turn she's doing me
she on the phone with her friends like how cool is she
(hey papi)
even if they don't understand the flow
they understand the dough
my ladies going
(hey papi)
promise you'll never let me go
promise you'll never leave me
promise we'll grow, they going
(hey papi)
even if they don't understand the flow
they understand the dough
the ladies going
(hey papi)
promise you'll never let me go
promise you'll never leave me
promise we'll grow, they saying
(hey papi)
even if they don't understand the flow
they understand the dough
my ladies going
(hey papi)
promise you'll never let me go
promise you'll never leave me
promise we'll grow, they going
(hey papi)
even if they don't understand the flow
they understand the dough
the ladies going
(hey papi)
promise you'll never let me go
promise you'll never leave me
promise we'll grow, they saying
(hey papi)
even if they don't understand the flow
they understand the dough
my ladies going
(hey papi)
promise you'll never let me go
promise you'll never leave me
promise we'll grow, they going
(hey papi)
