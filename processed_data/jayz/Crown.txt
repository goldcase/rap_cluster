"crown" lyrics
jay-z lyrics
"crown"
they can't keep a gooda man down
always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
they will never ever take my crown
who jah bless i say no man curse
things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse
here comes the officers askin' for a search
they found no weapon just only a draw of herbs
you in the presence of a king
scratch that, you in the presence of a god
put in the belly of the beast
i escaped, a nigga never had a job
scott boras, you over baby
robinson cano, you coming with me
these niggas is like rotary phones
it's a new day, hit up kd
niggas always try to knock a nigga down
knock me to my knees about a million times
uncle said i'll never sell a million records
i sold a million records like a million times
these niggas shouldn't let me in
i ball so hard on espn
see my name come across on cnn
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see it again
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see me again
shit on me
these niggas tried to shit on me
i was left for dead
they tried to wipe me out of your history
bulletproof glass, glass roof like the pope
bulletproof love, niggas down since the yolk
bitch asked if i was god
fuck i'm supposed to say, "no"
you already seen me turn a man to a g.o.a.t.
you already know what i could do with the coke
drop it in the water, made it disappear
i made it reappear, i had that bitch on a rope
i make my roof get ghost
bottom grill, i make my tooth get gold
all the shit did, i wasn't supposed to live
hallelujah hov
wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able
wasn't for the bread, probably be dead
best friends become ya enemies
niggas' knives are double-edged
