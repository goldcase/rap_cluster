"a dream"
(feat. faith evans, notorious b.i.g.)
it was all a dream
last night i had a dream
thoughts was racing through my head (it was all a dream)
felt so real to me
this is what was said..
had a dream i said, about who he said?
about b.i.g. i said, that's big he said
dig what he said, proceed he said
indeed i said, so - breathe i did
don't repeat what i say i said, he said nothing
he agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
what i believe to be a yes i repeated what was said
it came to me like a well as even i said
"what's the deal, playboy?" was the greeting he said
first thing i wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
"more money -- more problems, better believe it," he said
"careful what you wish for you might receive it," he said
i see i said, jealousy i said
got the whole industry mad at me i said
then b.i. said, "hov' remind yourself
nobody built like you, you've designed yourself"
i agree i said, my one of a kind self
get stoned every day like jesus did
what he said, i said, has been said before
"just keep doing your thing," he said, say no more
was it all a dream - tell me
was it all a dream, was it a dream
was it all a dream
i gotta know ("it was all a dream")
was it all a dream - was it a dream
was it all a dream, a dream
was it all a dream
it was all a dream, i used to read word up magazine
salt'n'pepa and heavy d up in the limousine
hanging pictures on my wall
every saturday, "rap attack," mr. magic, marley marl
i let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock
way back, when i had the red and black lumberjack
with the hat to match
remember rappin' duke? "duh-ha, duh-ha"
you never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
now i'm in the limelight 'cause i rhyme tight
time to get paid, blow up like the ("world trade")
born sinner, the opposite of a winner
remember when i used to eat sardines for dinner
peace to ron g, brucey b, kid capri
funkmaster flex, lovebug starsky
i'm blowing up like you thought i would
call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga
was it all a dream - tell me
was it all a dream, was it a dream
was it all a dream
i gotta know ("it was all a dream")
was it all a dream - was it a dream
was it all a dream, a dream
was it all a dream
("it was all.. a dream")
("it was all..")
("it was all.. a dream")
("it was all a dream")
("it was all.. a dream")
("it was all..")
("it was all.. a dream")
i see i said, jealousy i said
got the whole industry mad at me i said
then b.i. said, "hov' remind yourself
nobody built like you, you've designed yourself"
i agree i said, my one of a kind self
get stoned every day like jesus did
what he said, i said, has been said before
"just keep doing your thing," he said, say no more
