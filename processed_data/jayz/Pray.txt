"pray"
(feat. beyonce)
delivery me from my enemies oh god
defend me from those that rise up against me
deliver me from the work of inequities
the savior from the blood of me
look, mind state of a gangster from the 40's
meet the vicious mind of motown's berry gordy
turn crack rocks into a chain of 40/40's
sorry my jewelery so gordy
slid into the party with my new pair of maury's
america meet the gangsta shawn corey
hey young world wanna hear a story?
close your eyes and you could pretend your me
a cut from the cloth of the kennedy's
frank sinatra having dinner with the genovese
this is the genesis of a nemesis
mother america's not witnessing
the harlem renaissance birthed black businesses
this is the tale of lost innocences as the incents burn
and the turn tables turn and that al greens plays
i see my mother's afro as momma taps her toes as she rolls her jays
and my poppa just left the house, in search of the killer of my uncle ray
and she's trying to calm my nerves, as i observe this is just one day
and what tomorrow has in store we could never be sure so all we can do is
pray
because of your strength
while i walked upon the
for god is my defense
as i head towards my home room i observe the rooms though needles on the ground
i hear a car go vrooom drug dealer in the bm with the top down
as the girls start to giggle i ask why you laugh they say "you too little"
one day you'll understand when you become a man 'bout things you have to get you
fast forward freeze frame on my pistol
fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful
i didn't choose this life this life chose me
around here is the shit that you just do
i just left school, the same bm is pulled over by the boys dressed blue
they had they guns drawn screaming just move
unless there something else you suggest we can do
he made his way to the trunk, opened it like a huh
a treasure chest was removed
cops said he'll be back next month
what we call corrupt he called paying dues
now when the rules is blurred as they hears a  what am i to do
but pray, pray the lord forgive me
pray guys goodbye for what i'm about go through
pray
delivery me in thy righteousness
it cause me to escape and climb thy air until i am
save me lord
anyway there's oppression the drug profession
flourishes like beverages refreshing
sweet taste of sin everything i've seen made me everything i am
bad drug dealer or i victim i beg
what came first moving chickens or the egg
this is why i be so fresh i'm trying to beat life
because i can't cheat death
the truth is the shamelessness ain't stainless is that aim this is
you know who's game this is
move coke like pepsi it don't matter what the brand name is
i stand behind mine everything i do i'm a man behind mine
i'm not a angel i'm sure but every night before i lay
i drop my knees to the floor and i pray
the name shall endure forever
the name shall continue as long as the sun will
men shall be blessed in him
all nations shall call him blessed
in your name i pray
for you blessings
