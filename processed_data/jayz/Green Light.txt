"green light"
(feat. beanie sigel)
who da fuck can stop us niggaz, it's gangsta niggaz
it's gangsta!  woo!  it's gangsta nigga!
all g-g-gangsta nigga, uhh!
green light - go go, go-go-go, go
go go, go-go-go, go
you got the green light to drag your motherfuckin mink
green light - go go, go-go-go, go
throw your pinkie ring high in the motherfuckin air
go go, go-go-go, go
drop your top, c'mon!
now i done told y'all niggaz once before
y'all don't know who you fuckin wit
y'all gon' fuck around and make me come up out this music biz
(don't make me..)
this just a record deal, y'all motherfuckers been on some shit
bite my style, tryin to get rich, so i decided to flip my shit
bene-fit me like a tight outfit, like mr. biggs' about to have a fit
it's, a, bout, to, be, some, shit (please believe it)
see vin-dawg, and dre-shal, got a nigga real open y'all
i see haters peepin me, lookin hard like a pu-ssy
same fight, different round; same circus, different clown
same pussy, different town; assholes how you like me now?
kel' and jigga, the best of both niggaz
put two heads together, mean mo' figures (ha)
word to tigger, put me off up in the "bassment"
with the rest of the rap niggaz, watch ratings get bigger
i'm a pimp of this music, the tracks be my hoes
sisqo, don't make me kick you out like devoe
haters left, players right.. green light
go go, go-go-go, go
you have the green light to be as pimp as you want to
go go, go-go-go, go
green light - go go, go-go-go, go
go go, go-go-go, go
green light - go go, go-go-go, go
go go, go-go-go, go
green light - go go, go-go-go, go
oh dis gangsta!
go go, go-go-go, go
it's so muh'fuckin gangsta!
psycho, like no, bitch-ass niggaz
don't wanna see the r.o.c. so you creep low
shoot from the line like a free throw
with this 'nali of mine like a pi-co
leave niggaz far behind like a cheap hoe
on my grind every time that you see hov'
yeah i got it, come and get it, green light go (go)
red dot i stop ya, yellow niggaz move slow
red dot i got 'em, tell that nigga move slow
head shots pop 'em when i let the uz' go
he done told fool..
dunn think dunn loc'in when a gun smokin
tell dunn i been gun-totin
he don't know he facin death
hockey mask on jason's step
don't make me pop past your raisinette
you niggaz cow-ass
you bullshit, i pull shit, and keep a full clip
go go, go-go-go, go
go go, go-go-go, go
green light - go go, go-go-go, go
go go, go-go-go, go
green light - go go, go-go-go, go
go go, go-go-go, go
green light - go go, go-go-go, go
go go, go-go-go, go
