"we made history"
(feat. tony williams)
now that all the smoke is gone
and the battle's finally won
victory is finally ours
history so long so long so long
in search of victory she keeps saluting me
if only we can be together momentarily
we can make love and make history
why won't you visit me
until she visits me
i'll be stuck with a sister her name is defeat
she gives me agony so much agony she brings me so much pain
so much misery like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
as the crowd screams brother of the team i practiced so hard for this moment
victory don't leave
i know what this means i'm stuck in this routine
whole new different day same old thing
all i got is dreams no body else can see
nobody else believes nobody else but me
where are you victory
i need you desperately
not just for the moment to make history
so now i'm flirting with death
hustling like a g
when victory wasn't watching
took chance repeatedly
as a teenage boy before acne
before i got proactive i couldn't face she
i just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets
that's where i met success
we lived together shortly
now success was like lust shes good to the touch
shes good for the moment but shes never enough
everybodys had her shes nothing like v
but success is all i got unfortunately
but i'm burning down the block
i been in and out of v
but something tells me that there's much more to see
before i get killed cause i can't get robbed
so before me success and death monage
i gotta lost i gotta find v
we gotta be together to make history
now victory is mine she tastes so sweet
shes my trophy wife coming with me
we'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly
we'll name him history he'll repeat after me
hes my legacy son of my hard work future of my past
can explain who i be rate me amongst the greats either 1 2 3
if i ain't number one then i failed you victory
ain't in it for the fame that dies within weeks
ain't in it for the money you can take it when u leave
i wanna be remembered long after u breathe
long after i'm gone long after i breathe
i leave all i am in the hands of history
that's my last will testimony
this is much more than a song it's a baby shower
i been waiting for this hour history your ours
