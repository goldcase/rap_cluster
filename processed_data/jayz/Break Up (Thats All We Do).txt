"break up (thats all we do)"
make up, and break up
that's all we do
then we have sex, next thing you know
everything is cool
best of both worlds!  holla at your boy
like we always do about this time
uh-huh, yeah
i know what you doin ma
tryin to get in an argument with me so i can
do my mad thing, you want me to do my mad thing
i understand - c'mon!
seems we're always arguing, but
right after the arguing we have, sex
and somehow it's the best, yes
seems we're always arguing, but
right after the arguing we have, sex
and somehow it's the best girl
gangsta love, gangsta love
think about it while the streets you roam
it's dom p and army in the fridge when you get home
sex is always better fresh off a vendetta
we break up or break you off then we right back together
then this brand new leathers and caroline aurera
marijuana, white wine, somewhere under the weather
like we sick but we fine, shit we couldn't feel better
just some sunshine in mind lookin fine as ever
who got a mouth on her, woo, she put some words together
sometimes'll make a nigga wanna leave, but when we make up
woo!
boy talk boy!
break up to make up baby
seems that's all we do darlin
but no one wants to walk out the door
after all of the holla'n
cursing and fighting
and me sleeping on the couch
in the midst of our stormy weather
sex brings the sun out
after i hit that there
seems we don't have a care
sex makes you say i'm sorry
and things like i'm not goin nowhere
it's somethin bout the p-u-s-s-y
that keeps brother in check, even i
even if you was a pimp you couldn't survive
without the h-e-l-p to provide you
think about it while the streets you roam
it's dom p and army in the fridge when you get home
remember that night?  you was all like
maybe we should go our seperate ways for life
i hit the lights fit you tight at the lil' place right
i hit it right you look me right in the eyes like psych
you was goin through your act 'til i caught you in the sack
and i made you relax when i (hit it hard from the back)
yeah now we back friends
and the next time you need some sex counselin, we
seems we're always arguing, but
right after the arguing we have, sex
sex with best friends
from the bathroom to the kitchen (we sex)
from the kitchen to living room (we sex)
from the living room to upstairs (we sex)
upstairs to the attic (we sex)
attic to the basement (we sex)
from the basement to the car garage (we sex)
garage to the back of the jeep (we sex)
bicycle to the treadmill (we sex)
even over by the dirty lawnmower (we sex)
the neighbors and the dogs are lookin crazy (we sex)
i don't care because you're my baby (we sex)
it's our house, and we can have sex (we sex)
anytime we want to (we sex)
they can kiss my ass, because whoa-ho-hoo
hey l don you feel me?
yeah yeah yeah i feel you
you and jay crazy man, but it's all good
let's go
la-la-la-la-lah-la-la

la-la-la-la-lah-la-la - sex
