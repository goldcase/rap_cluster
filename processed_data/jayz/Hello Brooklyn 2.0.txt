"hello brooklyn 2.0"
(feat. lil wayne)
hello brooklyn how you doing? where you going? can i come too
and if i can i'm a be your man you could be my lady
and have my baby and drive my cars and drive me crazy
wherever you going baby girl just take me 'cause i'm so taken
if you taken i'm just sayin' baby i'm just sayin'
like a momma you birth me brooklyn you nursed me schooled me wit hard knocks better than berkeley
they say you murked me by the time i was 21 that shit disturbed me but you never hurt me hello
brooklyn if we had a daughter guess what i'm a call her brooklyn carter when i left you for
virginia it didn't offend your 'cause you no i only stepped out to get dinner and now i'm eating so
much i bought extra so much doe the dinner's now turn in to breakfast i only roll lexus to hug
your road i love your corners i'm half your soul
hello brooklyn what's your story she said she eating on the run but she ain't "nore"
she said she got a man but he ain't worried but baby i'm a have to rob 'em like "horry" she
said she love b.i.g and she like tupac and when i said jay-z she said it's the roc but i'm a
leave it like dis like dis like that where brooklyn at? where brooklyn at?... have you seen her?
and if she tell you somethin' you better believe her she told me she like my new orleans demeanor
and so i said goodbye katrina
and hello brooklyn b-b-baby you are the sweetest thing eyes
can see i said hello brooklyn but baby i hope you
you never say goodbye to me i said hello brooklyn b-b-baby
you are so damn fine to me and i remember the time, place, &
the weather on the day you said hi to me
and i say hello brooklyn
brooklyn you crazy look how you made me razor blades in my mouth walk around behaving all demented
black hoodies and timberlanded always scheming you see the gleam
on that niggas pendent hello brooklyn you bad influence look what you had me doing but i ain't mad
at you look at my attitude it says my life's too real pick up my ice grill baby i'm cold as ice
like i'm from brownsville but my bed's in the stuy though while i flatting your bush till we smoke a
c.i what up 2 the boy b.i you no i handle b.i i don't have steps on the caine ask the dreads about i
how you want so she likes it hard co... so i grind slow illa den outta square mall back in the 9.0'
my find hoe we got some victims to catch so in a couple years i'm a bring you some nets
