"la familia"
head of the family

welcome home to emory
let's get back to this dinero
niggas wanna kidnap wifey
good luck with that bruh
you must gonna hide your whole family
what you think we wearing black for
ready for that war
ready for that war ready
you ain't ready yo, you radio
you ain't really ready
real nigga outchea
alpo bought his bricks here
elvis got his records took
it's like we got our seventh gear
nfl investigations
oh, don't make me laugh
fbi investigation
we stood up to that
facts only
everything real in my raps only
every nigga real in my clique really
everyone is a movie star you got to film me
la familia
ready for that war
ready for that war, ready
you ain't ready yo, you radio
you ain't really ready
head of the family
el padrino
my brothers is my brother like my brother is
my nigga is my brother
like my mother kids
not in just in good times
that's that sucka shit
but it war times
it just what it is
head of the family
all my niggas bosses though
y'all don't understand we
we talk that shit bosses know
triple fuckin' og
what's up to my nigga juan
tell these niggaas pull their fuckin' skirt down
i could see their ovaries
niggas snitching switching teams
out there telling bitches things
industry talk behind your back
ain't nobody got time for that
facts only
everything real in my raps only
every nigga real in my clique really
even the girls keep it two hundred and trilly
it's la familia
