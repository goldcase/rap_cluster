"oceans"
(feat. frank ocean)
blessings, blessings yeah
i see elephant tusk on the boar of a sailing lady
docked on the ivory coast
mercedes in a row winding down the road
i hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo
before the basquait show and if so
well fuck it, fuck it
because this water drown my family
this water mixed my blood
this water tells my story
this water knows it all
go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
go ahead and watch the sun blaze
on the waves
of the ocean
dope boy still smelling like cocaina
white boat, white robe
can he be more cleaner
the oil spill that bp ain't clean up
i'm anti santa maria
only christopher we acknowledge is wallace
i don't even like washingtons in my pocket
black card go hard when i'm shopping
boat dock in front of hermes picking cotton
silk and fleeces, lay on my jesus
oh my god, i hope y'all don't get sea sick
see me in shit you never saw
if it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all
aww, whole world in awe
i crash through glass ceilings, i break through closed doors
i'm on the ocean, i'm in heaven
yachting, ocean 11
me and ty ty is like pablo and popeye
winding dirt roads on mopeds spilling opus
welcome to the magnum opus
the magna carta
the best-selling author decoded
on the holiday playing "strange fruit"
if i'mma make it to a billi i can't take the same route
swoosh
now that's the sound of the border
swoosh
now that's the sound of a baller
muhammad hovi my back against the rope, the black maybach
i'm back inside the boat
shepard fairey they finally gave me some hope
can't believe they got a nigga to vote
democrat, nope
i sold dope
in trouble water i had to learn how to float
on the ocean
i'm in heaven
yachting
ocean 11
