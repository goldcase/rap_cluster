"empire state of mind"
(feat. alicia keys)
yeah
yeah i'm out that brooklyn, now i'm down in tribeca
right next to deniro, but i'll be hood forever
i'm the new sinatra, and since i made it here
i can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
i used to cop in harlem, all of my dominicanos
right there up on broadway, pull me back to that mcdonald's
took it to my stash spot, 560 state st.
catch me in the kitchen like the simmons' whipping pastry
cruisin' down 8th st., off-white lexus
drivin' so slow, but bk is from texas
me, i'm out that bed-stuy, home of that boy biggie
now i live on billboard and i brought my boys with me
say what up to tyty, still sippin' mai tai's
sittin' courtside, knicks & nets give me high five
nigga, i be spiked out, i could trip a referee
tell by my attitude that i'm most definitely from....
new york, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
there's nothin' you can't do
now you're in new york
these streets will make you feel brand new
the lights will inspire you
let's hear it for new york, new york,
new york
(you welcome ogâ€”i made you hot, nigga!)
catch me at the x with og at a yankee game
shit, i made the yankee hat more famous then a yankee can
you should know i bleed blue, but i ain't a crip though
but i got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
afrika bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
for foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
8 million stories, out there in the naked
city it's a pity, half of y'all won't make it
me, i got a plug special ed "i got it made"
if jeezy's payin' lebron, i'm payin' dwyane wade
three dice cee-lo, three card molly
labor day parade, rest in peace bob marley
statue of liberty, long live the world trade
long live the king yo, i'm from the empire state that's
(that boy good... welcome to the bright light, baby.)
lights is blinding, girls need blinders
or they could step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, eve
caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
anna wintour gets cold, in vogue with your skin out
city of sin, it's a pity on a whim
good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
everybody ride her, just like a bus route
hail mary to the city, you're a virgin
and jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
came here for school, graduated to the high life
ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
mdma got you feelin' like a champion
the city never sleeps, better slip you an ambien
one hand in the air for the big city
street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
no place in the world that could compare
put your lighters in the air
everybody say "yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (c'mon, c'mon)
i'm from...
