(feat. john legend)
this is the operator with a collect call from "emory jones"

yeah nigga i bet we was kids and had dreams of bein here
i said "we" cause i'm here, you here!
uhh
yeah, ride with me, your spot is reserved family
cigarette boats, yachts, ain't nowhere we can't go
we in south beach and the hamptons too baby!
you know why they call the projects a project, because it's a project!
an experiment, where in it, only it's objects
and the object for us to explore our prospects
and sidestep cops on the way to the top - yes!
as kids we would daydream, sittin on our steps
pointin at cars like yeah that's our sex
hustlers, prophets, made our eyes stretch
swanson got the spot, shit we started our trek
some of us made it, most of us digressed
in the name of those who ain't made it my progress
show success please live through me
see i'm the eyes for emory, keep him alive
(this is a collect call) so everytime i press five
all he wanna hear is his boy talk fly
up in the fed, and still holdin his head
so when he hits the streets he gon' eat through this bread
now let's ride
uh-huh, geah
i'm crushin 'em all for jones
mtv, bet, the grammys, crushed linen, purple label
all that fly shit we talked about
give him some nice pinky rings with the blue diamonds and e'rything
hehehe, that's what we talked about right?
uh-huh... tried to told you, ride with me

singapore, all this from singin songs
comin up though we thought slingin raw

monster of the double entendre, coke is still my sponsor
heh, the cola, yeah
hova still gettin it in with soda

started from the crates now i'm sittin on a whole case
since they got you sittin on that old case
our dreams is on hold like tivo
so i can't wait 'til you get your date
i got some temp plates outside of the gate

look like the batmobile, the phantom the top just comes off that joint
