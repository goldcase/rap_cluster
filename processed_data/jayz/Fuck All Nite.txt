"fuck all nite"
(feat. pharrell williams (neptunes))
you used to all the attention, huh? (yeah!)
but you don't want no commitment, huh? (uh-uh!)
why not? -- you should be comin home with me
sittin in this lap with the luxury
now you can, come in the mornin while wakin up (yeah!)
actin like you behave and stuff (uh-huh!)
you should be comin home with me
sittin in this lap with the luxury, now check it
yes.. a lime to a lemon, my v-a women
walk in manolo blahniks cause my condo with elevators in 'em
she wanna wrinkle my linens
so i sprinkle her with gin and then we begin sinnin, uhh
blasphemy, oh my god, we be sinnin
she keeps scratchin me like she tiger in 'em
this is exactly, why i had to pin her
to the bed like a wrestler, her to press on her, uhh
her man kept pagin, stressin her
so i told her what to say just in case he question her
(situations.. will arise, but you gotta be smart about it)
no matter what you do, don't talk about us
don't give him no info, he'll be lost without it
just keep your mouth shut, we could do this again
bring a friend!
guess who's back in my motherfuckin house
half black, half white chick, i call her minnie mouse
.. we always hook up when we out
we do what we like to do and then we out
but lately i've been havin the strangest feelings
your boy young hov' catchin feelings
and it's messin up my dealings cause mami's not willin
to leave her boyfriend, she call me her toy-friend
said, "we was just 'sposed to hook up and have a glass"
she called me her emergency dick-in-the-glass
hehehe.. i had to laugh for a second
had to check myself, get my mackin back in perspective
i slack for a second but i'm back, no question
like i walk with a cane, ain't no half-steppin!
... jeah, and on that note
iceberg slim is back to rock a boat, c'mon!
let's just - fuck all night! yeah
until we both start yawnin
yeah
to the bright shirley murdock mornin
yeah
until we both start yawnin
let's just - fuck all night! yeah
let's have breakfast baby
yeah
have lunch, have dinner, back to breakfast baby
yeah
let's have breakfast baby
have lunch, have dinner, back to breakfast maybe
this is - if that kid don't get too suspicious
stop blowin up your digits
showin up livid, claimin he wanna fight
but shawn all business with his type (uh-uh) naw!
shawn just tryna keep the friendship tight
shawn to sean paul 'em if you "gimmie the light"
and this way you can stay for life, aight?
..
let's just - fuck all night! yeah
until we both start yawnin
yeah
to the bright shirley murdock mornin
yeah
until we both start yawnin
let's just - fuck all night! yeah
let's have breakfast baby
yeah
have lunch, have dinner, back to breakfast baby
yeah
let's have breakfast baby
