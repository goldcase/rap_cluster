"f.u.t.w." lyrics
jay-z lyrics
"f.u.t.w."
just let me great, just let me great
i feel like mothafuckin' cassius clay right now, genius!
don't be good my nigga, be great
after that government cheese, we eating steak
after the projects, now we on estates
i'm from the bottom, i know y'all can relate
fuck up the world
let's fuck up this world
fuck up the world
me and destiny got a date
martin had a dream, hov gotta team
my chain already heavy, don't let me get a ring
parades down flatbush, confetti on my fur
turn right on red hook, niggas heavy on the curve
see most of my niggas died early twenties or late teens
i'm just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1% of a billion more then niggas even seen
still they wanna act like it's an everyday thing, clean
high yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
legend of the summer in the rose bowl
came thru pasadena in the low low
just to show respect to the chulos
feel like a stranger in my own land
got me feeling like brody in homeland
i just want my shot to show my genius
standing on the top hold my penis
america tried to emasculate the greats
murder malcolm, gave cassius the shakes
wait, tell them rumble young man rumble
try to dim your lights tell you be humble
you know i'm gon shine like a trillion watts
you know a nigga trill as michael jackson socks
send a light to compton and the hundred blocks
lil bastard boy, basking on top
sipping d'usse boy this ain't your daddy yak
he in a cadillac; me? i'm in the maybach
this ain't grey sweat suits and white tube socks
this is black leather pants and a pair of stance
socks is my synopsis is clear
got stripclubs feeling like oxford, i swear
teacher teacher, i trying to unteach ya
all the shit they taught y'all, they got you all in the bleachers
when you front row at the knicks game, those the spike lees
you front row every where, you in the h.o.v's
jordan 1's and dungarees
and that's just the half of my warpath
make a million another million let my niggas make a million
'til we all check a billion, shit it's just the way i'm feeling
we have yet to see a ceiling, we just top what we top
cause the bars don't struggle and the struggle don't stop
