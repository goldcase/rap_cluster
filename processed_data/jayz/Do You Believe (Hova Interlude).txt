jay-z lyrics
"do you believe (hova interlude)"
well, i'm the ghetto's answer to trump
i'm cancer to the hamptons
20 million a wop, brand sac and mansions
increase the noise pollution, as soon as i land in
don't even trust uppity white folks
keep the cannon tuck
niggas trying to lean on jay, shots gonna stand you up
glocks gonna pop, ya not understandin much
i hustle for the thuggest
well, now i hustle for the rust, like fuck it baby
i just love it
chicks now say they like the way i thug it
since my album dropped,my stock grows like i went public
ladies i love ya
but i love my freedom more
i love my niggas, love to see them ball
i love bean's and bleek
them niggas like my peter and paul
my disciples, and that's right we coming for the title.....
do you believe, it's hova the god
