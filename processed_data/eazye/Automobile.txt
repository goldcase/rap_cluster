"automobile"
yo dre man, i take this bitch out to the movies and shit man we're kissin'
and grindin' and shit, so we hop in the back seat, you know man, this bitch
rubbin' all over my dick and frontin' like she's gonna give me the pussy,
man, and the bitch said three words, man:
stop, no and don't
i said biiiitttttcchh
you don't have to front on me dear,
so why don't you just give that pussy here?
if you'd be good to me,
oh i'll be good to you,
and we'll both ride home in my automobile.
all that i want is a little puss
all that i want is just a little head
if you'd be good to me
ohh i'll be good to you
and we'll both ride home in my automible
you don't have to front on me bitch,
don't be afraid - it's only a dick
give up the pussy soon,
all i want is a little,
or get your groopy ass out my hotel room
or get your groopy ass out my hotel room
all i want is the pussy
all i want is the pussy
all i want is the pussy
all i want is the pussy
if you'd be good to me,
oh i'll be good to you,
and we'll both ride home in my automobile
we'll both ride home in my automobile
