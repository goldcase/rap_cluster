"this is a recording for living in a fulltime era (l.i.f.e.)"
(this is a recording) (life)
living in everyday is something,
something everyday like this is our livin'
giving something sheer for the crowd is our major,
major to the crowd is to hear what we're givin'
no time to rest, we got work in the studio
studio suppliers rest at no time
showtime is enough when the soul is performing,
performing is the soul y'all, and it's showtime
coping with dates in clubs, can't even lounge,
lounge with the homeboys how we are copin'
scoping new material for paul to plug high-pitched,
high-pitched what paul plugs in and still scopin'
bearer of peaceful views to express peace,
peaceful expressions why we are bearers
what the soul tries to project is when existing in rap,
you're living in a fulltime era
(this is a recording!)
(this is a recording) (life)
puttin' in spin the rhyme, rappers fear so
fear so much of what pos is puttin'
couldn't do better, the punks they don't try hard
try hard enough, they don't, so they couldn't
no joke to what i do inside this field,
this field to me is filed, there's no joke
so soak up the fact there's no part-time,
part-time rappers at, so soak
taking in new ideals leads to new groups,
new groups to better the soul, i'm takin'
wakin' from days and nights to do my best
your best gets us paid
so i'll keep on wakin'
wearer of a plug logo to the dying,
dying are rappers who think i'm no wearer
what i'm trying to say is when dealing in rap,
you're living in a fulltime era
(this is a recording!)
(this is a recording) (life)
love is to all, to all goes my love
dove comes to peace like stand comes to sit
stand for the court, 'cause standing is healthy
healthy in sense is mentally fit
pause for the poets of a new style of speak
just here to do the same with no trick
grab the plug two's live wire, my brother
and find that you've grabbed my pet boa constrict
ring goes the garbage i'm hearing
seek for the truth, my brother is tearing
no time to back-step, 'cause if you back-step
look what you stepped in, you stepped in mess
so look what's around you
don't worry for the soul will find the truth
about three years from now, you know why?
'cause we're living in a fulltime era
(this is a recording!)
