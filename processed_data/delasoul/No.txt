"no" lyrics
de la soul lyrics
"no"
(feat. butta verses, yummy)
i never can say goodbye
no no n-no i, never can say goodbye
i, i don't know the rest
we those pros, we never procrastinate (ah)
them guardians they shouldn't let you get past the gate
watch out dawg, the watchdog's showin his teeth
(guess you bit too much shit) they bitin your beat
while i speak from experience, hunger and hurt
and a little bit of hate from niggaz doin me dirt
i just wash it all out with tide and show love
to those who ride with me while i'm puttin in work
full-timin it, 8:30 to 6, the graveyard shift
the three months before the benefits hit
but my position went temp' to perm'
i sat and listened like an intern watchin who applied get fired
now i'm sittin in the break room, they gotta make room (make room)
my paper stacks, put staples through 'em
so i can keep my money together
some die-hard fans just don't want it like, "put pos back on it"
i'm back on it, that's why you never disappointed
we give you what we live through for real (for real)
don't own a crown but i'm royalty
and tryin to see the royalty checks about a half a mil'
whether off or on the chart, my cuts grips your heart
(you know we got you open) like your gut splits apart
i never pass the buck, my shoulder holds the weights
so don't beef when we don't pass collection plates
i don't give money, i don't support the needy
schooled in america, taught to be greedy
and everything ought to be, easy
but i never could say goodbye to my friends who get high
i wonder why, i'm rockin with that guy, it's serious
still make him cry when the satire's hilarious
cold for your areas, flows come in various shapes and sizes
so hot that you despise it
never last up to bat (no no no no)
these skills we don't lack (no no no no)
we never fall and pray (no no n-no no)
make all the ladies say (ooh ooh baby)
you can't knock the hustle - not at all (no no no no)
can't be budged by your muscle (no no no no)
never ridin on e (no no n-no no)
it's de la and butta v (drive you crazy)
yo, if you are what you eat; some of you
cats heads between your girl's legs a lot cause y'all act too sweet
(go brush your teeth!) then after that
put in a little more practice on your rhymin attack
what you write's not the least bit hot
maybe cause your wrist is so cold from all that ice you cop
hate to hate a playa but you know what?
i still smother ya like cheese and rockin leaves freshly cut
and we the steak and potatoes and de la's the greatest
and ladies be on the floor thankin the lord that he made us
i'm tellin you, i swoop her like a pelican do
you sayin - look at that pelican fly; you spittin gelatin rhymes
they shaky as shit, ugly in the mold you fit
we the square peg on the round hole, sound's soulful
your imitation flavor is tofu
it's true we make our bed all day, and we are..
.. the world of rap! take you back
in the days of all four hundred ways that people lack
it's that (what) authentic, big-nosed mic music
four to five survive all night to it
i'm tryin to keep up with my jones' and thomas'
'til i'm broke like them new year's eve promises
and that's alright, i just penned another sixteen
to fill my bank account with the mixed greens
moms want 5's and 10's
the girls i got is 9's and 10's, vh1 "behind the pens"
you anticipate greatness from elder statesmen
i ch-ch-ch-ahh, like biz mark' or jason
i bust one shot just to start the racing
the tortoise and the hare, which one there is chasin?
slow and steady, we already andretti
get ticket take parades, waves and confetti and..
come on y'all
if the soul keeps rockin, the streets will keep rockin
if the streets keep rockin, the soul will keep rockin
if the streets stop rockin, the soul will keep rockin
if the soul keeps rockin, the streets will keep rockin
