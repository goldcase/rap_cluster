"down syndrome"
i be that mind blessin blessin these lessons we've ignited
want to bring it to my face man you're cordially invited
cause i've cited, you posess no science in your thinking
so i'm gonna (never) you're blinking!
fingers be pointin, and leakin falsifyin the stink
you think i'm pink i bl-l-link with them shades of thought and think
(and in this corner be the hush) so play on william rhodes
cause at the sound of the bell my circle square controls
and all mc's best sweat, we bringin buckets of heat
so don't fret kid i let you lick the love i secrete, yo
even my foes give me bravos, and that shows
total domination in this rhyme complication
yeah the skill is a cinch i rock the womb with a mic
and in the days of the nickel and breast, i knew de yes yes y'allin
was the callin, clearly not for the gat
for combat, i bring a bag of my rhymes for the sat
i'm plug one-of-a-kind, for you people's delight
and for you sucker mc's, step to your knees
ain't no second thoughts and all your thoughts are from orion
i can tell that you a devil by them rhymes you're designin
your play doggin tactics can't fuck with my facets
just because you talk all that glock shit don't mean you can rock shit!
your identities on freeze
just a form of protozoa tryin to cross them seas
see high horse riders gettin shot by the sheriff
cause nobody's safe for crimes
and even all you skirts need to checkin in your upstairs attic
cause mase is smackin hoes if hoes is startin static
now it ain't all good when your jam goes wood
so as a deterrant, i use mental current
got them brothers shook, peep the look comin out of the face
cause they all catch a bruise from the hits we make
your fame and cars should be listed as magnets
legends never die but they can get shot and killed
ain't nuttin glitter when you're battlin mc's
you once imitated in a mirror so to down syndrome you kneel
the same status i heard, the same nothin
my ears fears the faulty locks tryin to lock down the stops
but i earn more than your menudo or your boyz ii men
while down syndrome keeps you immune to frequencies i send
fresher than a sniff off havin them j in fifth
i identify with your rhythm
but i exist for more than just a benz, so mends
i'm cuttin off my friends to keep a smile calicum iron grain
let me tell you a little something about soul (tell em son)
i be a piece of the east coast, so give a toast to
plug wonder why back in the day who soaked his words in jigga
so when i ran a phrase in june you didn't catch it til december
i'm a member of them kids from the inner city
giving you kitties audible treats, you be aching for making
more money than a pagan holiday
not from the pj's, yet i still got something to say
say what man?  you gritty like a diamond grenade
for the cameo spot you tries to fool parade
you acrobats flip the star gazin map, for alla that
you'll be the first to place, and ran it all to a waste
and all the style that you bring (gotta make decks bend)
you gotta rip it from the start (when the beats come in!!!)
