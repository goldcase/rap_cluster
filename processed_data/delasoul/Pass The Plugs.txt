"pass the plugs"
(this time, put it in mellow)
pass the peas like they used to say
pass the peas like they used to say
pass the peas like they used to say
pass the peas like they used to say (ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha)
first p is passed
i am known as
posdnuos, plug one to the whole race
rhyme on a tour
smart and much more
dispatch i've stood themes with the mad face
tall dark and lean
was once nineteen
now i'm one year older with reason
clean thoughts and drawers
rhyme flow never stalls
the yes yes yes y'alls
will end this season
the soul reached high plains
we didn't reach soul train
but don don't like rap
so that won't happen
fame we don't lust
god we do trust
arsenio dissed us
but the crowd kept clapping
blessed with soul's lights
so turn off your brights
overexposure will bring about a clear soul
don't push, but piles,
for this here new style
and excuse me y'all while i fill my potholes
pass the peas like they used to say
pass the peas like they used to say
pass the peas like they used to say (oh yeah)
pass the peas like they used to say (ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha)
passed off second
tru i reckon
head full of dreds
but knowledge inside
singin' on records, making it hectic
wishing it all would fall and die
radio works it, public consumes it
tommy boy wants another "say no," huh
rough and rugged
it's not a new twist
been trugoy since the first get go
here's the daisy
watching it die, see?
native is the new like balance is the shoe
paul makes a mil like dill makes pickles
plus is to add like addin to the crew is
pimps promote us, rm's work us
mp's watch us close in focus
watch me steppin'
now i'm dancing
then disappear with a hocus pocus
pass the peas like they used to say
pass the peas like they used to say
pass the peas like they used to say
pass the peas like they used to say (ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha)
(people in the place this is very hard to conceal)
(pos get funky)
(check it out)
(people in the place this is very hard to conceal)
(dove get funky)
(check it out)
(people in the place this is very hard to conceal)
(mase get funky)
(check it out)
(people in the place this is very hard to conceal)
(prince paul get funky) (ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha)
(ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha)
pass the peas like they used to say
pass the peas like they used to say (yeah)
pass the peas like they used to say (mmm)
pass the peas like they used to say (ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha)
fourth p is passed
i am known as
(prince paul)
yeah thanks mase
applied like chapsticks
the songs are slapsticks
skeezoids with polaroids
give me such a case
trife or not trife
don't own a wife
yet i'm down and around for a good kiss
i got a 40 of pepsi
a girl in bed-stuy
and i'll end it like this!
(will rise, not fall)
( prince paul)
(our mentor, don't be sore)
(when i say that's all)
