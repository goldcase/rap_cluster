"i can't call it" lyrics
de la soul lyrics
"i can't call it"
yeah yo
to all my thrillas on the east (i can't call it)
to all my thrillas on the west (i can't call it)  "hello"
to all my thrillas inbetween (i can't call it)
you're bearing witness to the best (i can't call it)  "hello"
now other kids tried to be pros
well i'm protein
and real live inserted inside rap and soul fiends
there's a million mc's in the world tonight
who's not gettin' down cause they know them stakes got high
and them stakes got high cause yo that's how it is man
i'll take the markie up outta the biz
just to hang up place the name onto headline
"appearing live de la soul" first up to shine
it be me
while i arose from the shores from long isle
while little girls sport swollen stomachs like they in style
while their man hairline recedes cause they fashion from dust
that's why we all lust to live and ah live to lust
(i send a scream to my nigga busta bust)
down down will be some intricate word play comin' around
i'm not gay but i'm quick to say mase is my man
we done rocked from ny to osocka japan
(from osocka japan) i land back in ny
so don't test the world travelers we off to apply
cash the check cuase we knows the d
peace to all them mc's who got a child and record companies to feed
so all my thrillas over seas (i can't call it)
to all my thrillas makin' g's (i can't call it)  "hello"
(first tell 'em your name)
introducing doctor oman to your section
(and what you come here for?)
to say these rhymes in your direction
see your selection keep me frownin' crown you niggas (true dat)
shared a bottle with my crew and takin' swiggas (who dat?)
ain't no need to said no names we just revealin'
that my family keeps on top like a ceiling
dealin' like a gamble ain't no ramble or roast
(i heard you showerin' shit from coast to coast)
so how you call it when you niggas alcohol it?
i be calm in the corner soothing stress like a sauna
gonna (gonna) take my time (my time)
to raise my (hey young world)
inspired by rick and vance wright
trying not to boogie with the devil take my lessons just to keep my dance tight
phatter (fatter) than a waist 55 on the mic
and if ya wanna bug then do what cha like
and if ya wanna bug then do what cha like
self expression makes it health for self aiight
to all my thrillas in the north (i can't call it)
to all my thrillas down south (i can't call it)
and all my thrillas inbetween (i can't call it)
we about to be the hell out (i can't call it)  "hello"
"i really had a ball"
