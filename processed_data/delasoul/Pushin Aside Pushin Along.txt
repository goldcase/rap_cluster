"pushin' aside, pushin' along" lyrics
de la soul lyrics
"pushin' aside, pushin' along"
i'ma get to be the king of new york
when the queen and the crib be killing my nights
and a horse rode in her
she swear the fresh prince gonna fail
parents just don't understand
i'm just trying to get my kid on
posing in the mirror design
a stone chizzling the dmc, a pedigree m
a better me then
shit i'm chasing this bus
once we get on peak it's all about us
yeah but you can be a lawyer, put them down father boy
sory ma', i'm a microphone fiend,
addicted of the concept of rolling with a team
and rolling up sleeves in some boss' office
that all the mind of another man
switch that on the...up to this other plan
but she snap back at me like a rubber band
more concern cause she swim in the gutter
i just wanna cop her a crib and pops, well i don't know him
his position on the build is a veto
all our asses i'll be treated like an equal
come on mom
through the doubt and the stress
my eyes stay glue
if it all goes wrong,
i'll push it aside
i'll keep pushin' along
through the stress and no other doubt
my eyes are so glued to it
like the words in the song
we just pusin' aside, pushin' along
yep, attention from the parents
they just want the best, they want your ass up in...without falling
explain it to them it is my calling
it's like wearing a pack that has a parachute that might not open
and anyways, this shouldn't even be descended
in they mind, up world, with your wings extended
flight time is the best way,
but i'm listening to what my heart and my chest say
i want the rap game, my mama wanna...me
pops like, don't even spend another day on it
he keeps putting me down,
say i'm riding with my hobby in the front seat
responsibilities in the trunk and really need to just switch it around
unplug the dream, push it along
with talents in these streets is pusher of song
put smiles on the pretty girls' face
and ... dudes embrace, when he's giving me that
you can see it in they eyes that this nigga can rap
but my father, said i need a real blue color
can't support a family with a few dollars
but the damage is done, your son's a fiend
for microphone and break beats and drum machines
for large crowd yelling out pop and dean
it's swerve from the first serve making them lean
through the doubt and the stress
my eyes stay glue
if it all goes wrong,
i'll push it aside
i'll keep pushin' along
through the stress and no other doubt
my eyes are so glued to it
like the words in the song
we just pusin' aside, pushin' along
they'll like more pain, problem, more stress
i'm like, more lanes, albums, more bless
they like, not cheering it, not even hearing it
when i talk about i'm trying to be a pioneer in it
they're like this not the real job to fall on
i'm like it's what my soul seems to call on
i wanna hear them say jay we support you
but still in all i gotta do what i gotta do
yeah, and i'ma ride with them... let this doggy doggy step outside
... the ... i used to slam doors shut
mister parental advisor he was keeping his eyes on me
but this little piggy's trying to tell the world
with the blessing from his number one girl, i can do this mom
through the doubt and the stress
my eyes stay glue
if it all goes wrong,
i'll push it aside
i'll keep pushin' along
through the stress and no other doubt
my eyes are so glued to it
like the words in the song
we just pusin' aside, pushin' along
