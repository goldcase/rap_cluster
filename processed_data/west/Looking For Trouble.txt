looking trouble lyrics
kanye west lyrics
looking trouble
feat pusha big sean cyhi da prynce j cole
reup gang pusha
looking trouble trouble trouble
found muthafucker
yes
see black roses drug dealer poses
shoveling devil’s angel noses
never let jail turn shine moses
couldn’t cleanse soul civil rights sposes
panoramic roof glass like coaster
backseat driver racial slurs chauffeur
killian loafers mikimoto chokes her
photoop priceless frame wanted posters
audacity war brings casualty
bitch son face tragedy
ugh order hits orders mahi
rip vivian blake shout shower posse
gone
seek problems
looking trouble trouble trouble
found motherfucker
i’m it’s misogyny
bad bitches massaging me
sometimes lowered standards colleges
please don’t judge ugh following
fat bitches swallowing skinny bitches modeling
take givenchy let’s get raunchy
face looking captain cruncy
devil stay testing
’cause chase pussy it’s sin
falls lap it’s blessing
soon got salad spent dressing
french exact balmain impressive
used main leathers leathers leathers leathers
cyhi cyhi yeah
boy looking trouble
maybe wasn’t black wouldn’t struggled
player got trap niggas crooks huddle
cook smuggle
got twenty pounds kush duffle
i’m running circles
boy i’m looking like knuckles
look knuckles got hook ’cause niggas looking
i’ve tooken whoopings trust dog i’m good scuffle
don’t mad whooped ass ’cause i’ve tooken couple
feds asking niggas questions wouldn’t rebuttal
‘cause i’m jake gyllenhaal i’m hood bubble
tall model broad like took russell
didn’t play cards dealt made dealer reshuffle
royal flush kiss royal nuts
ain’t nothing silver spooned came soil bruh
i’m eating rather yellow gold
exquisite ravioli happy yellow hoes
don’t get confused rap mellow flows
‘cause titos got bricks like yellow road
good it
big sean nigga
found mutherfucker
bitch
i’m nosmoke sec’ rolling motherfucking ounces
marijuana mountains drinks you’re pronouncing
three chains don’t need bouncers
nothing less g stack’s trousers

new doubled’s smashed blouses
fuck hotel nigga rent houses houses
nigga rent houses
many wedding rings lost couches
i’m westside lover
leave females sheets feelings rubber
showtime showtime boy
hope set dvr
stacking money face face dish look like cpr
‘ye invited seat sit throne
i’m snapping like yo’ ass finished poem
sound like ‘ye jay drizzy drake
meanwhile i’m chilling niggas counting money ain’t
consider lucky see legend prime
killer crime big dime
greet wit middle finger see me
it’s cool ’cause can’t see yo’ ass side tv muthafucker
hey cole world make way chosen one
hear putting fear older ones
played downgrade like don’t notice son
shoes big fill barely squeeze toes ‘em
fucking hoes teaching niggas hold sons
rap moses scratch mary joseph’s son
high fuck cold flow loaded gun
never say i’m better hov i’m closest one
heard looking trouble i’m supposed run
yo’ bitch invited inside ain’t supposed cum
got niggas that’ll blow tee put hole one
outside heaven’s gate fronting like know someone
talking hard y’all still ain’t push me
say eat still ain’t pussy
fuck everybody get it
you’re hot everybody’s critic
you’re high everybody’s midget
mean mugging niggas mean nothing
could position one dreamed of
went quarter broke half past rich
badass bitch
don’t want problems math class shit
check young genius out
fuck world bust nut let semen sprout
thought real shit fiending ’bout
praying screaming ’bout
ironic sleeping one dreaming ’bout
