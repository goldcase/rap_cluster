hey mama grammy remix
last night saw dreams cant wait go sleep
last night saw dreams cant wait go sleep
mmmm mama
wanna scream loud cuz i’m proud a
let tell i’m do
mama know act fool promise i’m goin back school an
appreciate allowed a
three years old moved chi
late december harsh winter gave cold
fixed something good soul
famous homemade chicken soup another bowl
work late nights keep lights
mommy got training wheels could keep bike
would give anything world
michael jackson leather glove didn’t give curl
never put man me
love mommy cant see
seven years old caught tears eyes
cuz somebody cheatin telling lies started cry
knelt kitchen floor
said mommy imma love till don’t hurt more
i’m older aint gotta work more
imma get mansion couldn’t afford
see you’re unbreakable unmistakable
highly capable lady that’s makin loot
livin legend look heaven do
send us angel thank you
mama wanna scream loud cuz i’m proud a
let tell i’m do
mama know love an
never let go wrote song know matter go
last night saw dreams cant wait go sleep
last night saw dreams cant wait go sleep
last night saw dreams cant wait go sleep
life dream real life starts go sleep
mmmm mama
