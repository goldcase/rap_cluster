feat dwele
oh hey oh hey oh hey
hey hey
im living 21st century doin something mean it
better anybody ever seen it
screams haters got nice ring it
guess every superhero need theme music
one man power
clocks tickin count hours
stop trippin im tripping power
21st century schizoid man
system broken schools closed prisons open
aint got nothing lose motherfucker rollin

light skinned girls kelly rowlands
white mans world ones chosen
goodnight cruel world ill see mornin

21st century schizoid man

short minded niggas thoughts napoleon
furs mongolian ice brought goalies in
embody every characteristic egotistic
knows hes fuckin gifted
needed time alone thoughts
got treasures mind couldnt open vault
childlike creativity purity honesty honestly crowded grown thoughts
reality catching taking inner child im fighting custody
responsibilities entrust me
look diamond encrusted piece thinking
one man power
clocks tickin count hours
stop trippin im tripping powder
till fuck worlds ours
21st century schizoid man
