"breathe in breathe out"
(feat. ludacris)
yeah, breathe in, breathe out
if ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
push a big truck, pull ya keys out
girls go wild and pull ya deez out
breathe in, breathe out
let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
if a nigga act up, pull a desert e's out
when i pull the piece out niggas like "peace out!"
golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
i got to 'pologize to mos and kweli (probably)
but is it cool to rap about gold
if i told the world i copped it from ghana and mali? (mali!)
first nigga with a benz and a backpack
ice chain, cardi lens, and a knapsack
always said if i rapped i'd say somethin' significant
but now i'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
and it's still about the benjamins
big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
strippers named cinnamon
more chips than pentium
what'cha gon' buy next? whatever new trend it is
i'm tryin' to spend my stacks
and i'm so broke i look back like "damn, was i on crack?"
i mean twelve platinum chains, was i on that?
what the hell was wrong with me dog?
sing along with my y'all
yeah, breathe in, breathe out
if ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
push a big truck, pull ya keys out
girls go wild and pull ya deez out
breathe in, breathe out
let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
if a nigga act up, pull a desert e's out
when i pull the piece out niggas like "peace out!"
now even though i went to college and dropped out of school quick
i always had a ph.d.: a pretty huge dick
ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
and givin' head is like a whale, using the toothpick'
well, i'm in the club for a limited time
act now and get some action for $free.99
later on i might charge for m√©nage
heard her man was the boss of the floss
but she still want to toss me the drawers
and it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
and i'm still actin' calm than a mug
she asked "can you drive me and the hunnies to where my altima was?"
while we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
baby i fully understand
let me help you with a plan
while he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
give me some head, that'll really piss hi'm off
yeah, breathe in, breathe out
if ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
push a big truck, pull ya keys out
girls go wild and pull ya deez out
breathe in, breathe out
let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
if a nigga act up, pull a desert e's out
when i pull a piece out niggas like "peace out!"
i blow past low class niggas with no cash
in the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask
so when i go fast popo just laugh
right until i run out of gas or 'til i go crash
whatever comes first i'm prepared for the worst
whatever comes second i'll be there with my weapon
pullin' up in the lexuses/'lexeses, one on both hand
so i guess them gses was ambidextrous
coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
"k i need a free hand mammogram
i got weed, drink, and a handicam
all of which is legal in amsterdam"
so say my name like candyman
and i'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
but if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
you can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe
yeah, breathe in, breathe out
if ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
push a big truck, pull ya keys out
girls go wild and pull ya deez out
breathe in, breathe out
let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
if a nigga act up, pull a desert e's out
when i pull a piece out niggas like "peace out!"
