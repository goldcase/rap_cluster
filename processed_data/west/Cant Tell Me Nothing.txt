cant tell nothing lyrics
kanye west lyrics
cant tell nothing
dream buy way heaven
awoke spent necklace
told god id back second
man hard act reckless
much given much tested
get arrested guess get message
feel pressure scrutiny
act stupidly
bought jewelry louis v momma couldnt get me
drama people suing me
im tv talking like me
im saying feel man
aint one cosbys aint go hill man
guess money shouldve changed him
guess shouldve forgot came from
la la la la wait till get money right
la la la la cant tell nothing right
excuse saying something
uh uh cant tell nothing
ha ha cant tell nothing
uh uh cant tell nothing
let suicide doors
life homey decide yours
know jesus died us
couldnt tell decide wars
parallel double parked motherfucker sideways
old folks talking back day
homey day
class started 2 hours ago oh late
know already graduated
live anything magic made it
say talk much emphasis
oh theyre sensitive
dont ever fix lips like collagen
say something gone end apologising
let know problem man
alright man holla then
let champagne splash let man get cash
let man get past
dont need stop get gas
move rumors drive fumes cause
move room full nos
stay faithful room full hs
must pharaohs tune soul
buried tomb full gold
treasure whats pleasure
life uh depending dress her
devil wear prada
adam eve wear nada
im way fresher
way less effort cause try hard
thats die hard
ya homies looking like god
reminisce god
