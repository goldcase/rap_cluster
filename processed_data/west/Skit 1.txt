"skit #1"
i brought you brothers here to start our own fraternity
broke phi broke, we ain't got it.
broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
no, we have no money
we are sharin' jeans.
if i go outside, i got the only clothing on.
how many cars do we own? (none!)
how many cars do we own? (none, sir!)
should we let our woman go and be with the cat in the car?
yes, we will.
why? because we can't afford gas. say it with me!
(we can't afford no gas!)
say it!
(we can't afford no gas!)
so we ain't drivin'!
