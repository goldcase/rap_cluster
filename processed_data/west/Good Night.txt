"good night"
(feat. al be back, mos def)
i'm not sure anymore-more
who is knocking at my door-door
all the faces that i know
ja make them so sunny and true
i don't wanna say goodbye to you
so i'll just say good night to you
my people, no goodbyes to you
i'm just gonna say good night
right now i can see it so vivid
like it was just yesterday like i could relive it
me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip
and i'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
but it'll fade before i get to get a hold of that
man i wish i could stop time like a photograph
every joke that they told i'd know to laugh
man, man i wouldn't let a moment pass
what do it mean when you dream that you fallin'
what do it mean when you dream that you ballin'
what do it mean when you never dream at all then
and you don't really know cause you can't recall them
it's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
people you never got a chance to say bye to
maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
into real life, if you try to
so close, but so far
and so far, no cigar
we can't dwell on the past all we got is today
so i'mma live like there's no tomorrow
no goodbye
i don't wanna say goodbye to you
so i'll just say good night to you
my people, no goodbyes to you
i'm just gonna say good night
uhh, to you
if i part my heart will live through you
dream beautiful and unusual
wake up like everyday new to you
stay true to you, a hood musical
my art will live through you
dream beautiful and unusual
wake up like everyday new to you
stay true to you, a hood musical
i don't wanna say goodbye to you
so i'll just say good night to you
my people, no goodbyes to you
i'm just gonna say good night
i'm not sure anymore-more
who is knocking at my door-door
all the faces that i know
ja make them so sunny and true
