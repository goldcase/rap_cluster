"bad news"
didn't you know
i was waiting on you
waiting on a dream
that'll never come true
didn't you know
i was waiting on you
my face turnt to stone
when i heard the news
when you decide to break the rules
cos i just heard some real bad news
people will talk
like its old news
i played it off and act like i already knew
let me ask you
how long have you known too
you played it off and act like he's brand new
when you decide to break the rules
cos i just heard some real bad news
real bad news
real bad news
real bad news
oh you just gonna
keep another no you wont
oh you just gonna
keep it like you never knew
oh you just gonna
keep another love for you
oh you just gonna
keep it ike you never knew
while im waiting on a dream
that'll never come true
oh you just gonna
keep it like you never knew
my face turnt to stone
when i heard the news
whats on the news
