lord lord lord lyrics
kanye west lyrics
lord lord lord
feat charlie wilson mos def raekwon swizz beatz
something special
something new
something special
something new
lord lord lord
power observation
marvells frights strange delights
attributes properties disciplines novelties
ecstatic patterns calender design
wilderness tours guided blind
cool rulers standing still sweating shade
knew lights grew bright fame
dead wrong pageantry lottery games
slight hand provided extravagant fake
carnival till bell hustle age
clutch covet must give away
uninvited asked come stay
surprise life business anyway please
pardonly curious minds
peace safe passage precious time
hither gone day days
tiny stone illuminated star far gone
star large many more
make largest star show small
furthermore end end stop im pausing
witness isnt all
scotch pork chops
passion expansion order random
see dreamers see sleepers
sweet jesus life earth
seek heaven first
let put work
lord lord lord
lord lord lord
something special
something new
heels set mood
acquire liars
met heard jesus bells strings choir
got lines better niggas albums plural
king urban make shit sound rural
said hit deep need epidural
