eyes closed lyrics
kanye west lyrics
eyes closed
feat john legend
see eyes closed now
feeling like life froze
i’m hit ground
sold soul devil thats crappy deal
least came toys like happy meal
game could never win
cause love hate love again
get away misery
get away loneliness
get away fake bitches can’t take phoniness
get away wack tracks
make hits
i’m child lost world
lonely kids go bell ring
feeling like hell rings
bringing back down
checking background
ironic whats happening
imagine didn’t ends
wouldnt many imaginary friends
i’m spaced dog moon talk
wonder god ask mike moon walk
swear momma wish father talk more
stopped visiting around time sophomore
guess everything hate see him
ain’t finna change we’ll never agree again
till i’ll pouring soul
things see eyes closed
see eyes closed now
feeling like life froze
i’m hit ground
sold soul devil
know crappy deal
least came toys
like happy meal
i’m spaced dog
moontalk
wonder god asked mike moonwalk
know entertainment angels
adriana giselle
lets exchange angels
photoshoot crib
lets exchange angles
rockin nothin tom benz bangles
i’m anxious i’m gettin anxiety
begging one fuckin fashion houses hire me
say i’ve asshole
said acquire me
quiet call verbal dieting
give herbal chai tea
i’ll calm tai chi
bad white bitch like icet
i’m right dog i’m slightly off
i’m paranoid like bonin’ raw dog
wakin slight cough
yea that’ll make ya dick quite soft
plus neck hurt lemme take ice off
never meant hurt should’ve nights off
cost much live never took price off
see eyes closed now
feeling like life froze
i’m hit ground
