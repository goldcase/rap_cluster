heartless lyrics
kanye west lyrics
heartless
night hear talk coldest story ever told
somewhere far along road lost soul
woman heartless
could heartless
oh could heartless
could cold winter wind breeze yo
remember talking though
need watch way talking yo
mean things through
mean things got into
ayo know things aint told me
ayo things thats old me
wanna get back gonna show me
walk around like dont know me
got new friend well got homies
end still lonely
could dr evil
bringing side dont know
decided werent gonna speak so
3 phone

homie dont know shes hot cold
wont stop wont mess groove up
cause already know thing go
run tell friends youre leaving me
say dont see see me
wait couple months gonna see
youll never find nobody better me
talking talking talking talk
baby lets knock off
dont know through
dont know you
got something new see
gonna keep hating me
