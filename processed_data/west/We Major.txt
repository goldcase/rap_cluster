kanye west lyrics
major
feat nas really doe
motherfuckers better job roll watch roll and
cant control cant hold nuts
take sip yak wanna fuck
take hit chronic got stuck
really whats amazing keep blazing
towel door smoke days end
puff puff pass dont fuck rotation
hpnotic henny nigga thats chaser
turn nothin something pimpin thats savior
best things green pimp get paper
high ground instead skyscraper
cool thinkin local come homie major
major come homie major
feeling better head sunday afternoon
better chick say yes soon
daughter thats call karma
pray god dont grow breasts soon
projects gang signs thrown up
niggas hats broke thats grow up
else think shortys write rhymes blow up
get first car irs show up
aint never shit nine
nigga come flickin shine
put two two together little bad weather
gon whole family funeral line
ask reverand strip club cool tips help send pretty girl school
thats want like winos want good whisky
aint klan brought hood me
heard beat aint know write
first line hos ice
fourfours black christ flows would nice
rap big paper black mans plight
studio consol asked man right
verse sound like freestyle write
said nas fans want illmatic stillmatic
picked pad pencil jotted feel
like 12 years since nigga first signed
im free agent
im thinking time
build motown
cuz rappers deprived executive 9 5s
hurts see companies stealing life
love give blood sweat tears mic
yall copped lps yall fiends got dealt
im jesse jackson balcony king got killed
survived livest niggas around
lasting longer half clowns
look used cook game took
either way change came like sam cooke
feeling better ever felt today
like better late never orientation
still make better throwing cares away
