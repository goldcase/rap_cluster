white dress lyrics
kanye west lyrics
white dress
girl
wooooah oooh
girl
wooooah oooh
tryna sneak upstairs apartment
aren’t sight red eyes
flew slipped left side
satin gown asleep makeup
i’m tryna inside ‘fore wake up
girl
wooooah oooh
girl
wooooah oooh
problems thats past
everybody got problems baby got past
remember used things would make laugh
like ordering girl drinks masculine glass
like pina coladas getting caught rain
rocking flannels summer like kurt cobain
dolce gabbana gold chains
type girl probably deserve new last name
never let us thing
everybody lying bang
fire blew flame
ain’t denying baby changed
cause high heels clicking
lip gloss glisten
hips start switching
you’re pissed tripping
cause even we’re kissing baby girl feel different
friends diss like ‘no didn’t’
didn’t talking kitten
bitch still stripping
tryna get pair christian’s
swear god got going crazy
play say it’s work baby
well models coked walk straight
seem still love man hate
babe call back say say always
kept phone demanded always
see knew lies whole time
credit bad can’t get one cosign
woulda thought woulda busted dope crime
left nigga aint give sign
back club tight dress
dreams someday wearing white dress
seen lame it’s miracle she’a talk nigga
ten year ago swag
plus don’t like none girlfriends
quote unquote cause girlfriends got girlfriends
phone hollin’ niggas watever
lets fly euro make best summer ever
headed rome rome home
rome act like aint got fucking phone
accept wrong except nigga grown
can’t bitch moan session gettin stoned
nigga hop plane
bus train try come talk explain
rented whole bottom floor candle light dinner
turned lights put candle right her
told even though met club tight dress
first sight picture white dress
30 foot train diamond lorraine
make years pain
family sides i’m glad came
auntie couldn’t make oh thats shame
wedding june could better
lets fly euro make best summer ever
take last car eurostar
tell conductor drive far
told friends wasn’t excited
well we’ll go country side won’t invited
disturbed fussing fighting
tell peaches light herb reunited reunited
lets make move herds go somewhere private
i’m talking plane pilot
