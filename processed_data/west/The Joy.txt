kanye west lyrics
joy
jayz
feat curtis mayfield
add little sugar honeysuckle lamb
great big expression happiness
boy couldnt miss dozen roses
would astound you
joy children laughing around you
makings you
forefathers street authors
ars cheap office
rappers never got signed keep offers
girls thats way fine us keep of
gave handshake man’s sake
birthday suit cause damn cake
there’s crumbs damn place
want cum damn face
never understood planned parenthood
cause never met nobody plan parent hood
taking refills plan b pill
another shorty won’t make family will
don’t make can’t take hope family will
aint crazy don’t know insanity feel
c shorty it’s bad
still hear ghosts kids never had
electro metro little retro ahh perfecto
know demo boy act wild
aint get memo yeezy’s back style
one room got gidget got bridget
what’s tripped dawg sisters
nah aint listen black sisters
momma named white bitches
next time see fallopian
though jewelry’s egyptian know hunger’s ethiopian
stupid questions like “is gon dope again
seen anybody spoke him”
beat deserves hennessy bad bitch
bag weed holy trinity
mirror see enemy
life’s cursed well mine’s obscenity
momma shit used hear this
walls hood back pajama shit
afros marijuana sticks seeds ganja it
popping like sample i’m rhyming with
pete rock let needle drop
seen much kid surprised don’t needle pop
taking sips pop six pack miller nips
pink champale ballantine ale
bally’s feet help balance well
shit used balance scale
got honest parties momma’s
virgin marys try judge her
i’m like “where madonnas now”
give glory gloria
said “you raised boy fast raising warrior”
victorious they’ll never take joy us uh
keep hands get mine up
don’t let take fire
yeah okay
it’s pete rock kanye one two okay
