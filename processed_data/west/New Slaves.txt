"new slaves" lyrics
kanye west lyrics
"new slaves"
my momma was raised in an era when,
clean water was only served to the fairer skin
doing clothes you would have thought i had help
but they wasn't satisfied unless i picked the cotton myself.
you see it's broke nigga racism
that's that "don't touch anything in the store"
and there's rich nigga racism
that's that "come here, please buy more"
what you want a bentley, fur coat and diamond chain?
all you blacks want all the same things
used to only be niggas now everybody play me
spending everything on alexander wang
new slaves
you see it's leaders and there's followers
but i'd rather be a dick than a swallower
you see it's leaders and there's followers
but i'd rather be a dick than a swallower
i throw these maybach keys
i wear my heart on the sleeve
i know that we the new slaves
i see the blood on the leaves
i see the blood on the leaves
i see the blood on the leaves
i know that we the new slaves
i see the blood on the leaves
they throwing hate at me
want me to stay at ease
fuck you and your corporation
y'all niggas can't control me
i know that we the new slaves
i know that we the new slaves
i'm about to wild the fuck out
i'm going bobby boucher
i know that pussy ain't free
you niggas pussy, ain't me
y'all throwing contracts at me
you know that niggas can't read
throw on some maybach keys
fuck it, c'est la vie
i know that we the new slaves
y'all niggas can't fuck with me
y'all niggas can't fuck with ye
y'all niggas can't fuck with ye
i'll move my family out the country
so you can't see where i stay
so go and grab the reporters
so i can smash their recorders
see they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the new world order
meanwhile the dea
teamed up with the cca
they tryna lock niggas up
they tryna make new slaves
see that's that private owned prison
get your piece today
they probably all in the hamptons
braggin' 'bout their maid
fuck you and your hampton house
i'll fuck your hampton spouse
came on her hampton blouse
and in her hampton mouth
y'all 'bout to turn shit up
i'm 'bout to tear shit down
i'm 'bout to air shit out
now what the fuck they gon' say now?
