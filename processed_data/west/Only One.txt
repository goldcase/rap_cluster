one
feat paul mccartney
lay sleep
hear speak me
hello mari ya doin
think storm ran rain clouds movin
know youre happy cause see it
tell voice inside ya head believe it
talked god said sent angel
look gave you
asked one got two
know never left you
cause every road leads heavens right aside you
say
hello one
like morning sun
keep rising till sky knows name
hello one
remember are
youre perfect youre mistakes

hear hear out
wont go wont go
goodbyes goodbyes
hello hello

smile smile
next time look eyes
well wings well fly
hello one
like morning sun
keep rising till sky knows name
youre still chosen one
remember are
youre perfect youre mistakes
hey hey hey hey
tell nori tell nori

tell nori tell nori me
tell nori tell nori me
tell nori tell nori me
tell nori tell nori me
