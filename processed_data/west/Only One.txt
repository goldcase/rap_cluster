"only one"
(feat. paul mccartney)
as i lay me down to sleep
i hear her speak to me
hello 'mari, how ya doin'?
i think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
i know you're happy, cause i can see it
so tell the voice inside ya' head to believe it
i talked to god about you, he said he sent you an angel
and look at all that he gave you
you asked for one and you got two
you know i never left you
cause every road that leads to heaven's right aside you
so i can say
hello my only one
just like the morning sun
you keep on rising till the sky knows your name
hello my only one
remember who you are
no you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes
hey, hey, hey, hey
oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
remember how i'd say, hey, hey, one day
you'll be the man you always knew you could be
and if you knew how proud i was
you'd never shed a tear, have a fear
no you wouldn't do that
and though i didn't pick the day to turn the page
i know it's not the end every time i see her face
and i hear you say
hello my only one
remember who you are
you got the world cause you got the love in your hands
and you're still my chosen one
so can you understand
one day you'll understand
so hear me out, hear me out
i won't go, i won't go
no goodbyes, no goodbyes
just hello, just hello
and when you cry, i will cry
and when you smile, i will smile
and next time when i look in your eyes
we'll have wings and we'll fly
hello my only one
just like the morning sun
you keep on rising till the sky knows your name
and you're still my chosen one
remember who you are
no you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes
hey, hey, hey, hey
tell nori about me, tell nori
i just want you to do me a favor
tell nori about me, tell nori about me
tell nori about me, tell nori about me
tell nori about me, tell nori about me
tell nori about me, tell nori about me
tell nori about me...
