jesus walks me
ask
say prayers least 2 week
ain’t talking god know i’ve g
know embarrassed
prayers sound like ben stiller meet parents
ain’t good “give us day”
ladies trying give us free
i’m trying give us us pay
know strippers was
ghettofabulous rooms cyberus
jacuzzi wild cleanse us
please unfog cardierre lenses
god sends signs sometimes glimpses almost died
falling asleep benzes
something beat get tranquilized
play shows feel sanctified
gives direction can’t decide
alive tell ain’t said
jesus walks
god show way devil can’t break down
jesus walks
thing pray feet don’t fail now
jesus walks
think there’s something say
right wrongs
jesus walks
finally talked god ain’t afraid cause love strong
take name take fame
take shame take flaws take blame
feel dirt conceal hurt see bruise
walk shoes
weren’t deep thought
two choice kill either leave new york
i’m truth teller that’s say i’m sayin
thing radio playin cause payin
ain’t really hot more
beats would knock more
cares flock more
realize labels pay lies
blood gain disguise
you’re favorite artist shhhh
know hear huh wanna fear what
worst dream gonna hear that
con rap like john baptist
prepare way came say today
deceived us us thinking jesus really didn’t need us
loved you
loved boys hallway broadway
even meet dope every 4 days
strippers broad day norway
detroit player gators moreys
bars music walk god
scares prove itugh
jesus walks
god show way devil can’t break down
jesus walks
thing pray feet don’t fail now
jesus walks
everybody lift hands
right say me
“father thank forgiving everything ever done
jesus walking dying raising
sins forgiven i’m changed man
i’m healed i’m deliveredi’m rich it’s him”
walk walk walk walk walk
walk me
