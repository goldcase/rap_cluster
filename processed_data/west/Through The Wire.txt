"through the wire"
yo g they can't stop me from rapping can they?
can they, huh?
through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
for a chance to be with you, i'd gladly risk it all
through the fire, through whatever come what may
for a chance at loving you, i'd take it all away
right down through the wire, even through the fire
i spit it through the wire man
there's too much stuff on my heart right now man
i'll gladly risk it all right now
it's a life or death situation man
y'all don't really understand how i feel right now man
it's your boy kanye to the...
chi-town what's going on
i drink a boost for breakfast, and ensure for dessert
somebody ordered pancakes i just sip the sizzurp
that right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
not to worry mr. h 2 the izzo's back to wizzerk
how do you console my mom or give her light support?
telling her your son's on life support
and just imagine how my girl feel
on the plane scared as hell that her guy look like emmett till
she was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
she a delta so she been throwing them dynasty signs
no use me tryin' to be lyin'
i been trying to be signed
trying to be a millionaire
how i use two lifelines
in the same hospital where biggie smalls died
the doctor said i had blood clots
but i ain't jamaican man
story on mtv and i ain't trying to make a band
i swear this right here is history in the making man
i really apologize how i sound right now man
if it's unclear at all, man
they got my mouth wired shut for like i don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
you know we had reconstru...
i had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
looked in the mirror half my jaw was in the back of my mouth man
i couldn't believe it
but i'm still here for you all right now yo
this is what i gotta say yo
yeah, turn me up yeah
what if somebody from the chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
but he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
except he's really putting it down
and he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
and what we need to do in the game
good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
in the blink of an eye his whole life changed
if you could feel how my face felt you would know how mace felt
thank god i ain't too cool for the safe belt
i swear to god driver two wanna sue
i got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe; safe
my dawgs couldn't tell if i
i look like tom cruise on vanilla sky, it was televised
there's been an accident like geico
they thought i was burnt up like pepsi did michael
i must gotta angel
cause look how death missed his ass
unbreakable, would you thought they called me mr. glass
look back on my life like the ghost of christmas past
toys r us where i used to spend that christmas cash
and i still won't grow up, i'm a grown ass kid
swear i should be locked up for stupid shit that i did
but i'm a champion, so i turned tragedy to triumph
make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
know what i'm saying
when the doctor told me i had a um..  i was going to have a plate on my chin
i said dawg don't you realize i'll never make it on the plane now
its bad enough i got all this jewelry on
can't be serious man
