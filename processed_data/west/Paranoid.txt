feat mr hudson
paranoid
dont paranoid
dont so
baby dont worry it
lady dont even think it
worry bout wrong things wrong things
worry bout wrong things wrong things
worry bout wrong things wrong things
worry bout wrong things wrong things
tell right now
really wanna spend whole life alone
little time might good might us good
done good
cause make good could make hood
make come make go
make high make fly
make touch sky hey maybe so
time
mine checking cell phone baby no
wanna kill vibe another night
heres another fight oh go
baby dont worry it
lady well go floor
anyway dont know like do
theyll never know you
anyway dont know like do
theyll never know you
time
wanna complain nights alone
youre me
show gratitude leave attitude way back home
yea see em look
baby let em look give us cold looks cause look cold
yea heard word mouth
dont worry cant control
talk world lost world
till finally let thing go
wanna check heartbreak hotel
sorry closed
baby dont worry it
lady well go floor
anyway dont know like do
theyll never know you
anyway dont know like do
theyll never know you
baby dont worry it
lady dont even think it
worry bout wrong things wrong thing
worry bout wrong thing wrong thing
worry bout wrong thing wrong thing
worry bout wrong thing
anyway dont know like do
theyll never know you
anyway dont know like do
theyll never know you
