devil new dress lyrics
kanye west lyrics
devil new dress
love though
love though
uh put hands constellations
way look sin sensation
know i’m preaching congregation
love jesus done learned lot satan
mean nigga lot waiting
aint married tonight need consummation
may lord forgive us
may god’s us
magic hour seen good christians make rash decisions
oh happened religion
oh lose it
putting make up
casually allure
text message break casualty tour
gone wake love more
thought ass hole guess it’s rubbing off
hood phenomenon lebron rhyme
hard humble stuntin jumbotron
i’m looking like “this really want huh”
argue anyway oh forgot summertime
uh put hands constellations
way look sin sensation
know i’m preaching congregation
love jesus done learned lot satan satan satan satan
mean nigga lot waiting
aint married tonight need consummation
sun go magic hour
magic hour
outta colours still skies
got green mind
see eyes
standing face screwed up
don’t leave hot that’s mase screwed up
throwing shit around whole place screwed up
maybe call mase could pray us
hit jamaican spot bar take seat
ordered jerk said eat
see always loved sense humour
tonight seen quiet room was
lyor cohen dior homme thats dior homme dior homie
crib scarface couldn’t tony
love could phoney
uh put hands constellations
way look sin sensation
haven’t said word haven’t said word
evening
cat got tongue
lookin’ bitch bet give ass bone
lookin’ wrist it’ll turn ass stone
stretch limousine sippin’ rosé along
doubleheaded monster mind own
cherry red chariot excess character
black tux nigga shoes lavender
never needed acceptance outsiders
cyphers yeezy mouth wired
jaw shattered climbin’ lord’s ladder
still speedin’ runnin’ signs like don’t matter
uh hater talkin’ never made mad
never i’m favorite papertag
therefore g4s clearport
come tools fool i’m pep boy
came dope quick export
never tired ballin’ it’s next sport
new mercedes sedan they’ll export
many cars dmv though mail fraud
different traps gettin’ mail from
polk county jacksonville rep melbourne
whole clique appetite tapeworms
spinnin’ teddy pendergrass vinyl jay burns
shed tear nights over
god bless man put ice over
gettin’ 2pac money twice over
still real nigga red coogi sweater dice roller
i’m makin’ love angel death
catchin’ feelings never stumble retracin’ steps
