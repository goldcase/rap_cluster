survive america lyrics
kanye west lyrics
survive america
us living upsidedown
new word revolution
people dont even want hear preacher spill spiel
gods whole card thoroughly piqued
america blood tears instead milk honey
youngsters programmed
continue fucking woke one night
digging paul revere nat turner good guys
america stripped bed yet closed eyes
signs truth tattooed across often entered vagina
learned amazement untold tale scandal
two long centuries buried musty vault
hosed daily gagging perfume
america bastard
illegitimate daughter mother country
whose legs spread around world
rapist known freedom freedoom
democracy liberty justice revolutionary code names
preceded bubblin bubblin bubblin bubblin bubblin
mother countrys crotch
webster say soul
want good home wife
children food feed every night
said done build new route china theyll you
survive america
survive america
survive america
survive america
