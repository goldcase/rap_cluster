kanye west lyrics
coldest winter
lonely nights start fade
lonely nights start fade
love thousand miles away
love thousand miles away
memories made coldest winter
goodbye friend ever love
memories made coldest winter
4am cant sleep
4am cant sleep
love see

memories made coldest winter
goodbye friend ever love
memories made coldest winter
winter winter
goodbye friend ever love
goodbye friend ever love
goodbye friend ever love
goodbye friend ever love
spring take snow away
spring take snow away
melt away mistakes
melt away mistakes
memories made coldest winter
goodbye friend wont ever love
never again
