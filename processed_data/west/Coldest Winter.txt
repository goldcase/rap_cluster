"coldest winter" lyrics
kanye west lyrics
"coldest winter"
on lonely nights i start to fade
(on lonely nights i start to fade)
her love is a thousand miles away
(her love is a thousand miles away)
memories made in the coldest winter
goodbye my friend will i ever love again
memories made in the coldest winter
it's 4am and i can't sleep
(it's 4am and i can't sleep)
her love is all that i can see
(her love is all that i can see)
memories made in the coldest winter
goodbye my friend will i ever love again
memories made in the coldest winter
winter, winter
goodbye my friend will i ever love again
goodbye my friend will i ever love again
goodbye my friend will i ever love again
goodbye my friend will i ever love again
if spring can take the snow away
(if spring can take the snow away)
can it melt away all of our mistakes
(can it melt away all of our mistakes)
memories made in the coldest winter
goodbye my friend i won't ever love again
never again
