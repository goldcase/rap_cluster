drive slow lyrics
kanye west lyrics
drive slow
feat paul wall glc
drive slow homey
drive slow homey
ya never know homey might meet hoes homey
ya need pump brakes drive slow homey
homey mali used stay one 79th may
one best friends back day
street form calumet school full stones
nicknamed krock theyd leave alone
bulls jacket hat broke way off
walk around mall radio face off
plus spinner daytons hand
keys hand reason let know hes man
back rocked alesis dreams caprices
drove teachers even polices
get cash today father passed away
left little something 16 stunting
al b sure nigga hair wavy
hit lakeshore girls go crazy
hit freeway go least bout 80
boned much summer even baby
see back back car
chi town version baby
virgin baby
one reasons looked crazy
used love play demo tape system yanked
felt like almost signed shit got cranked
well take saturday circle mall
lincolns auroras hurting all
girls lot flirting involved
dawg fuck flirting im trying get draws

ya never know homey hoes homey
ya need pump breaks drive slow homey

im posted parking lot trunk wavin
candy gloss immaculate simply amazing
elbows poking wide candylac
trunk open screens neons lit fifth relax
im mission dime pieces sexy ladies
allow introduce cl mercedes
starstudded event valet park
open mouth sunlight illuminates dark
see 4s crawling see screens falling
disco ball mouth insinuates im balling
im leaning switch sitting crooked slab
could still catch boopas drove cab
young houston hard hitter scrilla
riding candy coated crawling like caterpillar
im tipping 4s im jamming screw
im looking hoes baby do
drive slow homey
turn hazard lights see hoes
drive slow homey
riding around city nowhere go
drive slow homey
live today cause tomorrow man never know
ya never know homey might meet hoes homey
ya need pump brakes drive slow homey
cars like movies cars like crib
got tvs live
dont make sense baby im shit
everything flip know something serious
got custom grill got brabus rims
got baller genetics baby thats evident
see player flicking aint convinced
go kiss little bit
wear custom kicks got jesus chain
canaries gleaming though angle wings
see hoes acting like seen king

wood grain oak im riding vogues
cylinder quiet like tip toes
sold os know
see hoes little homey drive slow
chopped screwed

drive slow homey
ya never know homey might meet hoes homey
ya need pump brakes drive slow homey
drive slow homey
