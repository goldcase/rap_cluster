"h.a.m"
(with jay-z)
it was all good just a week ago
niggas feel theyselves and then watch the throne drop
niggas kill themselves
what niggas gon do hov?
this a new crack on a new stove
i'm in the two-door, true that
niggas tellin' me "you back"
like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
and if life a bitch suck my dick huh?
and i bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
by the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga
just forget it, you talk it, i live it
like eli i did it, jokes on you muthafucker and i get it
no paper hoe, but you can have some more of me
or-gy, or are we speakin methaphorically
historically, i'm kickin' bitches out like pam, nigga
goin' ham nigga, me and jigga
and a nigga still young, wanna have no kids
but i've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
and a few white girls, asses flat a shit
but the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit
got em jumpin' out the building
watch out below, a million out the door
i'm about to go ham
hard as a muthafucker,
let these niggas know who i am
i'm about to go ham
hard as a muthafucker,
let these niggas know who i am
fuck y'all mad at me for?
you don't even know what i've been through
i play chicken with a mack truck
y'all muthafuckers woulda been moved
i swam waters with great whites
y'all muthafuckers woulda been chewed
i hustle with vultures late nights
y'all muthafuckers woulda been food
fuck wrong with these dudes
try to walk around in these shoes
see the shit i saw growing up
and maybe you can take a peek at these boo's
niggas fantasize about the shit that i do daily like
these rappers rap about all the shit that i do really
i'm like really half a billi nigga
really you got baby money
keep it real with niggas
niggas ain't got my lady money
watch the throne don't step on our road
bad enough we let you step on our globe
when my nephew died, daddy dead
niggas took the price on my uncles head
nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
so i feel like i would like to know my uncles bread
bow down, brother pay homage
don't spill hate all on my garments
commes des garcon, fuck your fresh
head shots nigga fuck your vests
fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
peace god cause you know a nigga just went ham
hard as a muthafucker,
let these niggas know who i am
yeah i'm 'bout to go ham
hard as a muthafucker,
let these niggas know who i am
yeah i'm 'bout to go ham
