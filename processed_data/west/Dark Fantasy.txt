kanye west lyrics
dark fantasy
yeah yeah yeah yeah
fantasized back chicago
mercy mercy murcielago
that’s first year blow
say broke spanish hablo
drown sorrow diablo
found bravery bravado
dj’s need listen model’s
ain’t got fuckin’ yeezy serrato
ain’t got yeezy nigga
stupid fuck know
i’m chitown nigga nice flow
bitch new phoebe philo
much head woke sleepy hollow
get much higher higher higher
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
look like fat booty celine dion
sex fire i’m king leona lewis
beyond truest
hey teacher teacher
tell respond students
refresh page restart memory
respark soul rebuild energy
stopped ignorance killed enemies
sorry night demons still visit me
plan drink pain over
what’s worse pain hangover
fresh air rolling window
many urkels team that’s wins low
don’t make pull toys huh
don’t make pull toys
fire engines
make noooise
get much higher higher higher
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
mall seance
kids parents
sky filled heron
saw devil chrysler lebaron
hell wouldn’t spare us
fires declare us
took pills kissed heiress
moved back paris
get much higher higher higher
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
get much higher higher higher
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
