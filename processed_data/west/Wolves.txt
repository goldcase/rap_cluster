"wolves"
(feat. sia & vic mensa)
lost and beat up
dancin', down there
i found you, somewhere out
right 'round there, right right there
lost and beat up
down there, dancin'
i found you, somewhere out
right down there, right 'round there
lost and, found now
turn down, i'm lost
daddy, found out
how you turned out, how you turned out
if mama knew now
how you turned out
you too wild, you too wild
you too wild, you too wild
i need you now
i do, love you
found you, found you
right now, right now
right now, right now
if your mama, knew now
how you turned out
you too wild
you too wild, you too wild
you too wild, and i need you now
lost and found now
i, i'm not sorry
cry, you'll be sorry when this hennessey
don't fool yourself
your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
don't fire fight
yeah i feel you burning, everything's burning
don't fly too high
your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
i'm just, bad for you
i'm just bad, bad, bad for you
don't fool yourself
your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
don't fire fight
yeah i feel you burning, everything's burning
don't fly too high
your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
i'm just, bad for you
i'm just bad, bad, bad for you
i'm just bad, bad, bad for you
i was lost and, beat up
turned out, burned up
you found me, through a heartache
knowin', you were drawn in
i was lost and, beat up
i was warm flesh, unseasoned
you found me, in your gaze
oh i found me, or jesus
i was too wild, i was too wild
i was too wild, i was too wild
i was too wild, i was too wild
amongst the yellow eyes
