appalled
feat rza jayz pusha swizz beatz  cyhi prynce
one hand air don’t really care
two hands air don’t really care
it’s like sometimes mean ridiculous
it’s like sometimes shit’s ridiculous
one hand air don’t really care
middle finger air don’t really care
it’s like sometimes man ridiculous
life sometimes ridiculous
i’m appalled
spalding balled
balled donald trump taking dollars yall
baby fire girlfriend hired
don’t mind i’ma keep call
law don’t give fuck yall
got dogs chew fuckin’ hole wall
since lovers
need rubbers
don’t use rubbers need covers
house keeping mean gawd damn one time
let bad bitch sweeping
know get o’s like cheerios
know cuz seen us videos
know day play me
day mtv play videos
little joke voila
praises due high allah
praises due fly prada
baby im magic tadah
address highness
high united 30000 feet invited
niggas writin’ bullshit like gotta work
niggas going real shit man outta work
that’s never gawd damn dance track gotta hurt
that’s rather spit something gotta perch
champagne wishes 30 white bitches
mean shit fucking ridiculous
fucking ridiculous mean shit is
fucking ridiculous
5 star dishes different exotic fishes
man shit fucking ridiculous
fucking ridiculous
begin this
i’m offended
even mentioned fucking beginners
i’m appalled might buy mall
show niggas much store
i’m fresher all
don’t pause
y’all suck balls draws
dark knight feeling die hero
live long enough see become villain
went favourite hated
would rather underpaid overrated
moral victories minor league coaches
‘ye already told major cockroaches
show boats ferrari testarossa’s
hammer went broke know i’m focused
lost thirty mill spent another 30
cuz unlike hammer 30 mill can’t hurt me
fucking insane fuck sayin’
fly i’m fucking playing
little bitches big britches
burning little bridges
fucking ridiculous
champagne wishes thirty white bitches
mean shit fucking ridiculous
fucking ridiculous
mean shit fucking ridiculous
5 star dishes different exotic fishes
man shit fucking ridiculous
fucking ridiculous
success make it
take come
half mill twenties like bill i’m from
arrogant drug dealer legend i’ve become
cnn said i’d dead 21
black jack pulled aces
looking king face
everything dream muthafuckers im watching take shape
i’m young rich nigga lacks faith
range rove leather roof
love war fuck truce
still move bird like i’m bed mother goose
hoes come bakers dozen
claiming know really wasn’t
keep city’s best never said brightest
don’t affect slightest
never met bitch didn’t need little guidance
dismiss past dissappoint highness
speak gospel hostel
tony time nostrils
paranoid mind i’m still watchful
eye law aspire more
kilo’s came gave bobby brown jaw
flaws aint flaws it’s makes call
flow similar legend falls
spillin’ yeah
champagne wishes thirty white bitches
mean shit fucking ridiculous
fucking ridiculous
mean shit fucking ridiculous
5 star dishes different exotic fishes
man shit fucking ridiculous
fucking ridiculous
outrageous
wear pride sleeve like bracelet
god ipod i’d playlist
phrases amazes faces places
favourite huh
cup runneth hundreds
dummy dammit like waste it
new commandment thou shall hate kid
movement like civil rights i’m ralph david
abernathy call lady rosa parks
nothing like niggas baby marks
met girl valentines day fucked may
found april chose march
damn another broken heart
keep bitches two’s nigga noah’s ark
got seven call dro mark
plus trojan pocket matt leinert
gat pathfinder
cause haters got phd’s
y’all major haters math minors
tiger woods don’t make grab iron
yo champagne wishes dirty white bitches
know shit fucking ridiculous

know shit fucking ridiculous
cars missus furs mistress
know shit fucking ridiculous

one hand air don’t really care
two hands air don’t really care
it’s like sometimes mean ridiculous
it’s like sometimes shit’s ridiculous
one hand air don’t really care
middle finger air don’t really care
it’s like sometimes man ridiculous
life sometimes ridiculous
