"stronger" lyrics
kanye west lyrics
"stronger"
work it, make it, do it,
makes us harder, better, faster, stronger!
work it harder, make it better,
do it faster, makes us stronger,
more than ever, hour after,
our work is never over.
na-na-na that that don't kill me
can only make me stronger
i need you to hurry up now
'cause i can't wait much longer
i know i got to be right now
'cause i can't get much wronger
man i've been waitin' all night now
that's how long i've been on you
i need you right now
i need you right now
let's get lost tonight
you could be my black kate moss tonight
play secretary, i'm the boss tonight
and you don't give a fuck what they all say right?
awesome, the christian and christian dior
damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
i ask 'cause i'm not sure
do anybody make real shit anymore?
bow in the presence of greatness
'cause right now thou hast forsaken us
you should be honored by my lateness
that i would even show up to this fake shit
so go ahead go nuts go ape shit
especially in my pastel on my bape shit
act like you can't tell who made this
new gospel homie, take six, and take this, haters
i need you right now
i need you right now
me likey
i don't know if you got a man or not,
if you made plans or not
if god put me in your plans or not
i'm trippin' this drink got me sayin' a lot
but i know that god put you in front of me
so how the hell could you front on me?
there's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
i'm trippin', i'm caught up in the moment right?
cause it's louis vuitton don night
so we gon' do everything that kan like
heard they'd do anything for a klondike
well, i'd do anything for a blonde-dike
and she'll do anything for the limelight
and we'll do anything when the time's right
ugh, baby, you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)
i need you right now
i need you right now
you know how long i've been on you?
since prince was on appolonia
since oj had isotoners
don't act like i never told you
baby, you're making it (harder, better, faster, stronger)
i need you right now
you know how long i've been on you?
since prince was on appolonia
since oj had isotoners
don't act like i never told you
never told you
never over
