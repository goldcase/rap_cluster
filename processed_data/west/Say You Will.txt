kanye west lyrics
say will
would make calls blue
im awake sleepless til noon
hey hey hey hey
dont say will
unless will
hey hey hey hey
dont say will
play will
pray will
mrs sofly crashlands room
cant waste time might leave soon
hey hey hey hey
dont say will
will
hey hey hey hey
dont say will
one day will
pray will
grab neck touch soul
take cool lose control
hey hey hey hey
dont say will
will
hey hey hey hey
dont say will
will
pray will
wish song would really come true
admit still fantasize you
you
hey hey hey hey
dont say will

hey hey hey hey
please say will
