christian dior denim flow
told i’m tryna eat going dinner for
miami nights search a
tryna hide what’s obvious see me
conversate bit dna
salmon coloured suits vma’s
oh watching fuck wasn’t
skip across stage 5 dozen
yeah 6 grand minutes time
italian vogue styled nigga minute rhyme
lets clear lets fair
best things music’s offered here
round table full bosses here
still giving like coffins near
it’s time lesson model behaviour
damn look bad bitches gave you
man see flaws flavour
look like wonder woman still need saviour
maybe billionaire maybe cocaine
done seen drugs money run whole game
good girl lost city life
agent provocateur holding titties right
i’m haute couture hoes galore
give girl newport ’cause she’s smoking yours
i’m authority model seniority
call les need me
handcrafted material champagne cereal
shorty stole heart criminal lucky charm
fly clothes lear shows type kind stuff on
stuff problems bong i’m puffin’ strong
locked way thinking cuffs gone
must’ve liquor talkin’ i’m beggin’ cups “c’mon”
might come irregular come custom form
tgif gt breeze hustler’s poem
sound’s fullgrown reminds favorite chronic kush
ball like supersonic make haters vomit uh
nigga make money ‘fore make comment
meant snap ago knows time went
probably dime chicks whips diddy
i’m back like nine milli runnin’ new york city
see clearly storm
world’s mine sits pretty palm
sean continue on
niggas think know i’m guy story
dont really know what’s head fuckin’ me
better
could start basics
dior dior galore love cut
seem forgotten i’m nini
people dont know cud’ know what
rose gold presidential boney wrist
took ma chanel lc stunner
got haters fam made us
don’t really matter escaping paper
“hey ya” i’m andre 3000
i’m good nigga don’t need counseling
woke room mojo active
looks hoes likely passive
back let reflect old shit
i’m new act new script
bitches better thoughts approaching
done heard baby save niggas
things living haters copy i’m image
haters copy i’m image
