"guilt trip"
(feat. kid cudi)
i need to call it off, i need to make it known
'nother one, something gone, capricorn
dancing out on the lawn, fancy like the things she likes
she lives her life, i'm living mine
all dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray
all dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray
maybe it's cause she into leos
and i was into trios, plus all the trips to rio
couldn't have helped, it's gettin' cold
better bring your ski clothes, pick it through the keyhole
the door locked by myself and i'm feelin' it right now
cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
blocka-blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
your feelings like zulu, then nothing is a shaka
i hit her with jamaican dick, i'm the new shabba
she lookin' for her daddy, call me big poppa
on to the next saga
focus on the future and let the crew knock her
star wars fur, yeah i'm rockin' chewbacca
the one chief rocka, number one chief rocka
all dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop, chop chop
all dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray
none ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray
none ah dem have the guts to bust the sk
in my mind, in my, in my mind
in my mind, mind, mind, mind
in my mind, in my, in my mind
in my mind, mind, mind, mind
in my mind, in my, in my mind
mind, mind, mind
ohh
if you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
if you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
if you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
if you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
let me go, let me go
in my mind, in my, in my mind
in my mind, mind, mind, mind
in my mind, in my, in my mind
in my mind, mind, mind, mind
in my mind, in my, in my mind
mind, mind, mind
