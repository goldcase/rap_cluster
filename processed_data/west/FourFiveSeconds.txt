fourfiveseconds
rihanna  paul mccartney
think ive enough
might get little drunk
say whats mind
might little time
cause kindness
taken weakness

im tryna make back home monday mornin
swear wish somebody would tell me
ooh thats want

got three days til friday
im tryna make back home monday mornin
swear wish somebody would tell me
ooh thats want

wondering ive been

promise youll pay bail
see want buy pride

taken weakness
im fourfiveseconds wildin
got three days til friday
im tryna make back home monday mornin
swear wish somebody would tell me
