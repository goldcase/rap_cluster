welcome heartbreak
feat kid cudi
friend showed pictures kids
could show pictures cribs
said daughter got brand new report card card
got brand new sports car

head keeps spinning
cant stop visions
gotta get wit it
oh ho oh ho oh ho
head keeps spinning
cant stop visions
gotta get wit it
oh ho oh ho oh ho
dad cracked joke kids laugh
couldnt hear em way first class
chased good life whole life long
look back life life gone

seen seen before
ive seen ive seen before
seen seen before

couldnt figure want take
bad enough showed late
leave fore even cut cake
welcome heartbreak

cant stop visions
gotta get wit it
oh ho oh ho oh ho
