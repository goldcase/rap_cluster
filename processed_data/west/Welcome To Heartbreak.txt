"welcome to heartbreak"
(feat. kid cudi)
my friend showed me pictures of his kids
and all i could show him was pictures of my cribs
he said his daughter got a brand new report card (card)
and all i got was a brand new sports car
uh
and my head keeps spinning
can't stop having these visions
i gotta get wit' it
oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
and my head keeps spinning
i can't stop having these visions
i gotta get wit' it
oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
dad cracked a joke all the kids laugh
but i couldn't hear em all the way in first class
chased the good life my whole life long
look back on my life and my life gone
where did i go wrong?
i seen it, i seen it before
i seen it, i seen it before
i've seen it, i've seen it before
i seen it, i seen it before
my god sister gettin' married by the lake
but i couldn't figure out who i want to take
bad enough that i showed up late
i had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake
welcome to heartbreak
oh ho
oh ho
oh ho
and i can't, and i can't stop
no, no i can't stop
no, no, no, no i can't stop
no, no, no, no i can't stop
can't stop, i can't stop, i can't stop
no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no
no, no i can't stop
can't stop having these visions
i gotta get wit it
oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
oh ho
oh... oh ho
