"the one"
(with big sean)
(feat. 2 chainz & marsha ambrosius)
the storm is on the horizon
i'm standing here alone
got a pistol on my hip
and it's gonna be some shit
if you want it then bring it on
see i'm a motherfuckin' soldier
and i'ma be here till it's done
and when they asking who i'm is, shit
you just tell them that i'm the one
(one, one, one)
tell them that i'm the one
(one, one, one)
tell them that i'm the one
i'm the one, baby
yeah, i'm the one, baby
since god gave his only begotten son, baby
it's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately
so i had to put the church on the drums, baby
you on a run, baby
you on a run, baby
you think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby
you think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
mhm that's cool but i been runnin' on the sun, baby
we on a galaxy that haters cannot visit
that's my reality so get off my scott disick
if you ever held a title belt you would know how michael felt
tyson, jackson, jordan - michael phelps
yeah, had to take it to another realm
cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
best way to describe my position is at the helm
best way to describe my new whip - yeeeaaaalmmp
the storm is on the horizon
i'm standing here alone
got a pistol on my hip
and it's gonna be some shit
if you want it then bring it on
see i'm a motherfuckin' soldier
and i'ma be here till it's done
and when they asking who i'm is, shit
you just tell them that i'm the one
(one, one, one)
tell them that i'm the one
(one, one, one)
tell them that i'm the one
i told detroit i'ma fuckin' get it
i told my brother we'll be fuckin' winnin'
ye told me i'm the man for the job
so i told my mom, call her's up and tell 'em that she quittin'
started off in that chevrolet, but it's ferraris i gotta drive
i'm on hbo with my entourage
i'm 5'9" fuck a 9 to 5
i need a hundred million no compromise
i'm a double xl nigga
magazine and condom size
see what i seen and be traumatized
i don't wait, i marinate, variate erryday
erry state, sold out, fuck around and need a barricade
my weed loud i need a hearing aid
livin' life behind a pair of shades
i be a billionaire if i could get a dollar
for all the bullshit that i hear a day
i did it
the storm is on the horizon
i'm standing here alone
got a pistol on my hip
and it's gonna be some shit
if you want it then bring it on
see i'm a motherfuckin' soldier
and i'ma be here till it's done
and when they asking who i'm is, shit
you just tell them that i'm the one
(one, one, one)
tell them that i'm the one
(one, one, one)
tell them that i'm the one
treat the back seat like a sofa bed
break bread with my niggas, call it profit share
this some good shit, but it get better
and yeah my bitch cold, nigga thin sweater
like my verse suede and the beat leather
just tryin' to stay above sea level
when my nigga went to jail, i said, "free gucci"
i done bought so much shit, i should get free gucci
bought my baby momma anaconda bags
i shouldn't have bought it all
i should've went and cut the grass
snake ass niggas in my fuckin' face
bring your girl here nigga so i could fuck her face
yeah i run this place, this is cash mill swag
niggas treadmillin' goin' nowhere fast
sittin' courtside at the hawks game
louie's on, i could trip a fuckin' ball player
fuck yeah, awesome, yeah i lost some of my mind
and then i found weed was really kind of awesome
it's possible, goddamn right
i've been honest the whole time
