"chain heavy"
(feat. talib kweli, consequence)
my chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy
my chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy
they try to tell me my chain broke the levy,
maybe cuz its flooded,
why you walkin' round with a baby cross his cousin,
my teeth already white yall gone make me floss for nothing,
my teeth real diamonds what's the cause of the frontin',
while yall got all caps on?,
don cheadle time,
get extra black on em',
burn hollywood burn,
take too long for niggas to get their turn,
probably be cremated before i get my urn,
they try to tell me that aliens built the pyramids,
i swear life's a bitch on a period,
for every inch they cut the nose off the sphinx,
i make my jeweler add a few more links,
you can look at me and dont fuck what nobody thinks,
and my face always lookin' like somebody stinks.
my chain heavy, yeah yeah, my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy
my chain heavy, yeah yeah, my chain heavy, my chain heavy, my chain too heavy
here we go, like we should
feel the sweat, on ya face
here we go, like we should
feel the sweat, on ya face
alright, okay
here we go, like we should, like we should, like we should
question..
what color was the skin of the man who bared the cross?
no matter how many lashes they couldn't beat it off,
how many caskets will we see in one lifetime?
that's why its miles davis kobe it's mic time,
i keep that gold book on a ottoman,
and wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the 1800?s,
yall forget that i got called nigger on twitter so many times,
yo i lived that,
now i'm just trying to find where to raise my kids at,
cuz they don't want niggas next to where they crib at,
hey real tom lookin' for a nice park,
twelve noon she say my family gone make it too dark,
this is the flow that solar eclipses,
so hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse the bullshit, they got us listenin' to,
in this existence,
don't give up now just a little more persistence,
i am the day ice cube met michael jackson,
keep 'em away huh, something might happen,
this is the making of a masterpiece,
so we broke out the chains and told the master peace.
some wear a suit and tie, they dont wanna remain average
some wear a suit and tie like a chain in a straight jacket
my chain heavy stopping that traffic
coppers harrass us, the da attack us want us in chains like ba baracus
and a major factor in my decision to be a rapper was rebellion
being anti-establishment was attractive to a black kid from brooklyn
flames got them things cooking, land of the jooks
where the lames got the chains tooken
it aint looking good for you if you a tourist
yeah sometimes our rhymes is on a frequency that only purists hear
a couple rappers try to beef with me, nobody scared
niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared
why i gotta battle rappers, i debate scholars
question: do it gotta make sense if it make dollars?
sick visions is living inside our brains
its like sadomasochistic addicted to whips and chains
figuratively quite, literally, clinically insane spit flames when i vist the higher planes
try in vain to ignore, don't buy the chain if you can't afford it
'ye them load of a-whores by the boards trust
uh, that old ball and chain had me chained up for weeks
of course i'm off the chain as soon as i hit the streets
and now when we leak she saying the games over
i drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker
now the new dude she saying that could stay over
should be a chain who goes by the name of choker
thats what he did when she told him he should play this over
so the chains on, throw em on the way over
but when i came over, his only response
well be the owner of a chain of restaurants
cause i'mma eat your food for that chain that i worn
cause you be running round like the chain makes the man
so it obvious that he don't know the chain of command
cause my chain commands, that kind of respect
and its so chunky that its a pain in the neck
but it came with a check, i remember on chaining day
it spoke for itself and this is what the chain would say
"them chain snatchers are hoping that you aint ready
so don't get distracted keep your aim steady
or there'll be a chain reactionsince my chains heavy"
