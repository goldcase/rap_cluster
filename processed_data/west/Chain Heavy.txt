question
color skin man bared cross
matter many lashes couldnt beat off
many caskets see one lifetime
thats miles davis kobe mic time
keep gold book ottoman
wrote hooks slaves slaughtered 1800s
yall forget got called nigger twitter many times
yo lived that
im trying find raise kids at
cuz dont want niggas next crib at
hey real tom lookin nice park
twelve noon say family gone make dark
flow solar eclipses
hopefully one day real soul eclipse bullshit got us listenin to
existence
dont give little persistence
day ice cube met michael jackson
keep em away huh something might happen
making masterpiece
broke chains told master peace
wear suit tie dont wanna remain average
wear suit tie like chain straight jacket
chain heavy stopping traffic
coppers harrass us da attack us want us chains like ba baracus
major factor decision rapper rebellion
antiestablishment attractive black kid brooklyn
flames got things cooking land jooks
lames got chains tooken
aint looking good tourist
yeah sometimes rhymes frequency purists hear
couple rappers try beef nobody scared
niggas fucking corny nobody cared
gotta battle rappers debate scholars
question gotta make sense make dollars
sick visions living inside brains
like sadomasochistic addicted whips chains
figuratively quite literally clinically insane spit flames vist higher planes
try vain ignore dont buy chain cant afford it
ye load awhores boards trust
uh old ball chain chained weeks
course im chain soon hit streets
leak saying games over
drove crazy became chain smoker
new dude saying could stay over
chain goes name choker
thats told play over
chains throw em way over
came response
well owner chain restaurants
cause imma eat food chain worn
cause running round like chain makes man
obvious dont know chain command
cause chain commands kind respect
chunky pain neck
came check remember chaining day
spoke chain would say
chain snatchers hoping aint ready
dont get distracted keep aim steady
therell chain reactionsince chains heavy
