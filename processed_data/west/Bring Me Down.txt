bring down
feat brandy
always knew one day
theyd try bring down
wow one day tried bring down
always knew one day theyd try bring down
way down
going mass today pray
besides pastor say say
since pac passed away
rappers dont even deserve track me
see ever wanted ever anything
thered always somebody shoot dream
therell always haters thats way is
hater niggas marry hater bitches hater kids
theyre gonna take life fore take drive
cause barely living thats kept alive
thought maybe could better time
make grind fore im mind

ima look mirror need help
ill speak heart fronting
everybody feel way k least feel something
come bet forget get you
kind dream found see im often cross way
forgetting heaven let tried bring down
