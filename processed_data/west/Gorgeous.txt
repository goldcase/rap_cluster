gorgeous lyrics
kanye west lyrics
gorgeous
feat kid cudi  raekwon
aint question want need it
feel slowly drifting away me
im edge playing im saying
never ever let live down
nothing ive forseen dream it
feel slowly dripping away me
chances blow bogus
never ever let live down
penitentiary chances devil dances
eventually answers call autumn
fallin love ballin
got caught 30 rocks cop look like alec baldwin
inter century anthems based inner city tantrums
based way branded
face jerome get time brandon
airport check bag tell random
stay winning week bad massage
need happy ending new beginning
new fitted job opportunities thats lucrative
real world homie school finished
done stole dreams dunno it
treat cash way government treats aids
wont satisfied til niggas get get it
aint question want need it
feel slowly drifting away me
im edge playing im saying
never ever let live down
hip hop euphemism new religion
soul music slaves youth missing
road redemption
malcolm west whole nation standing attention
long im polos smilin think got me
would try crack ever see black me
thought chose field couldnt sack me
nigga aint shootin jump shot running track meet
pimp top mount olympus
ready worlds game olympics
make em say ho cause game pimpish
choke southpark writer fishstick
insisted get offa dick
drugs niggas cant resist it
remind tried ali enlisted
ever one greatest nigga must missed it
aint question want need it
feel slowly drifting away me
im edge playing im saying
never ever let live down
need drinks less lights
american apparal girl tights
told director tryna get school
said take glasses get pool
since watched tube
cause like crip said got way many blues bad news
looking resume feeling real fresh today
rewrite history dont believe yesterday
whats black beetle anyway fucking roach
guess thats got sitting fucking coach
god said need different approach
cause people looking like im sniffing coke
funny anymore try different jokes
tell em hug kiss ass x o
kiss ring thing im got it
play strings dramatic
end wack shit
act like aint belt two classes
aint got im comin whoever it
im coming whoever it
blowing thats good fantastic
yall like yall
dont really give fuck all
cause people tried black ball me
forgot 2 things black balls
know cops hems lifting lenses
kid armani suits fresh fruits bally boots benzes
counting smoking one cuff
live red jag louis bag grabbing blunt fuck it
steam hundred one ls
kites jails buying sweats running stetson
nigga hat game special
matched every black pair nikes
throwing dice decimals
older head bolder head would train soldier head
make sure right field soldier dead
got made code red
break black skunk
black dutch back old shed
cant live dying
give buy in
keep real keep moving keep grinding
keep shining every young man plan
learn others like brothers rae kanye
nothing ive forseen dream it
feel slowly dripping away me
chances blow bogus
never ever let live down
