send up
feat king l
rockstar bitch call elvis
mob call selfish
success got em jealous
shortys killing im drilling
tattoos break news
real made news
last night bitches came twos
suck like came lose
dropped first day school
cause niggas got cocaine move
going hard got name prove
killing em honey make pain improve
send bitch cant go down
send bitch cant go down
send bitch cant go down
send bitch cant go down
send bitch cant go down
send bitch cant go down
send bitch cant go down
send bitch cant go down
greatest shit club
since da club
packed might ride around
bodyguards back like prince club
say get friends club
say get benz club
treat friends like benz
park ass outside til evening end
go raw like leave in
wake like go again
go work gotta call in
cant go work clothes again
heart colder souls men
louboutin toes again
tight dress dancing close him
yeezus rose again
send bitch cant go down
send bitch cant go down
send bitch cant go down
send bitch cant go down
memories dont live like people do
always member you
whether things good bad
memories have
