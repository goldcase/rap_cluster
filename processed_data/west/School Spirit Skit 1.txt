kanye west lyrics
school spirit skit 1
beat that
mothers sayin “go college”
u finish college wonderful
u feel good
partying crazing
don’t forget drug habit u picked school bein around peers
hey you’ll get  25 thou job year
you’ll spend money crack cocaine it’ll you’re money
borrowin money mom high
get ur degree tattooed back excited it
u continue work gap several interviews oh god
you’ll come entry level position u that
u kiss enough ass you’ll move next level
secretary’s secretary
boy great get take messages secretary
never went college
shes actually bosses niece apart family
know college you
makes really smart man
kids want talk back class listened ok
hall monitor meant
know many classes took extra classes extra classes
i’ve never sex know degree keeps satisfied
lady walks says “hey u know whats sexy”
say “no don’t know bet add change purse fast”
