kanye west lyrics
falls down
feat syleena johnson
oh falls down
im telling ohh falls down
man promise shes self conscious
idea shes college
major majored dont make money
wont drop parents look funny
tell aint insecurrre
concept school seems securrre
sophmore three yearrrs aint picked careerrr
like fuck ill stay herre hair
cause thats enough money buy pairs new airs
cause baby daddy dont really care
shes precious peer pressure
couldnt afford car named daughter alexus lexus
hair long looked like weave
cut look like eve
dealing issues cant believe
single black female addicted retail well
man promise im self conscious
thats always see least one watches
rollies pashas done drove crazy
cant even pronounce nothing pass versace
spent 400 bucks this
like nigga aint this
cant even go grocery store
without ones thats clean shirt team
seems living american dream
people highest got lowest self esteem
prettiest people ugliest things
road riches diamond rings
shine hate us floss cause degrade us
trying buy back 40 acres
paper look low astoop
even benz still nigga coopcoupe
say fuck police thats treat em
buy way jail cant buy freedom
well buy lot clothes dont really need em
things buy cover whats inside
cause make us hate ourself love wealth
thats shortys hollering ballas at
drug dealer buy jordans crackhead buy crack
white man get paid that
aint even gon act holier thou
cause fuck went jacob 25 thou
house id again
cause wanna 106 park pushing benz
wanna act ballerific like terrific
got couple past due bills wont get specific
got problem spending get it
self conscious im first admit it
