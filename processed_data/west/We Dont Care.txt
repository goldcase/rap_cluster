dont care lyrics
kanye west lyrics
dont care
people thats drug dealin jus get stack ya money till gets sky high
wasnt supposed make past 25 jokes still alive
throw hands sky say dont care people say
first time hearing
experience something cold man
never nothing handed took nothing granted
took nothing man man im man
shorty looked dopeman
adult man knew wasnt broke man
flickin starter coats man man ount man
dont care people say
niggas outside winter
cuz summer aint finna say next summer im finna
sittin hood like community colleges
dope money lil treys scholarship
cause aint tuition havin ambition
aint loans sittin ass home
forced sell crack rap get job
gotta something man ass grown
drug dealin jus get stack ya money till gets sky high
kids sing kids sing
wasnt supposed make past 25 jokes still alive
throw hands sky say dont care people say
second verse dogs working 9 5
still hustle cause nigga cant shine 655
everybody selling makeup jacobs
bootleg tapes get cake up
put shit layaway come back
claim people kids income tax
take money cop work push packs get paid
dont care people say
momma say wanna move south
scratchin lottery tickets eyes new house
around time doe ran dudes house
couldnt get job
since couldnt get work figured hed take work
drug game bolemic hard get weight
niggas money homo hard get straight
gon keep baking day get cake
dont care people say
niggas
drug dealin jus get stack ya money till gets sky high
kids sing kids sing
wasnt supposed make past 25 jokes still alive
throw hands sky say dont care people say
know kids gonna act fool
stop programs school
dcfs dislecsic
favorite 50 cent songs 12 questions
scream rock blows weed park
smart

hold hold fast make mocash
tell momma belong slow class
bad enough welfare
trying put school bus space wheel chair
im trying get car chromy wheels here
tryin cut lights like dont live here
look whats handed us fatheres abandoned us
get hammers gone call ambulance
sometimes feel one world understands us
dont care people say
niggas
drug dealin jus get stack ya money till gets sky high
kids sing kids sing
wasnt supposed make past 25 jokes still alive
throw hands sky say dont care people say
