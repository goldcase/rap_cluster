"creepers"
(performed by kid cudi)
yeah, i see you waitin' over there
see you jockin' over there
see you lookin' at my girl over here
why you worried 'bout this girl over here?
keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
turn my head and hey
i see you waitin' over there
i see you jockin' over there
thinkin' bout your own life
why you talkin' 'bout the young, you dig?
i'm just doin' my thang, if you know what i mean, get it right
and they think they know and they think they know
they deal it for real
i'm just doin' my thang, if you know what i mean, get it right
and they think they know, and they think they know
they deal it for real
i'm just doin' my thang, if you know what i mean, yo
i don't love who i am so i'm workin' on a fix
i don't need a bitch trying to take my mind off my grip
if i had one wish it'd be to have more wishes, duh
fuck tryna make it rhyme, throw them stones, with your bitch ass
cutting me deep and even though i bleed i stand alone
alone i'll be, heart of a lion still shining on your sucka ass
work it, work it, work it, for inner peace
fightin' for the freedom of my soul, i can hear the speech
yeah i mumble while i'm trippin' on so many pills
hah, they figured that they know a nigga
yeah, i see you waitin' over there
see you jockin' over there
see you lookin' at my girl over here
why you worried 'bout this girl over here?
keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
turn my head and hey
i see you waitin' over there
i see you jockin' over there
thinkin' bout your own life
why you talkin' 'bout the young, you dig?
i'm just doin' my thang, if you know what i mean, get it right
and they think they know and they think they know
they deal it for real
i'm just doin' my thang, if you know what i mean, get it right
and they think they know, and they think they know
they deal it for real
i'm just doin' my thang, if you know what i mean, yo
