welcome jungle
jayz
feat swizz beatz
welcome jungle
welcome jungle well
asked wanna 25
turned around looked said alive
welcome jungle welcome jungle well
black axl rose move halfs wholes
come jungle ask hov
move blocks squares move apples pears
work pots pans cop airs
uncle died daddy too
paralyzed pain barely move
nephew gone heart torn
sometimes look sky ask born
faith god every day hard
every night worse thats pray hard
pray hard crazy god
thought everything lost all
que sera get case ciroc
let chase pain goes far
dreams big reality set in
let clip automatic weapon
shots door died vegas
though fought hard knew wouldnt make it
im tortured soul live disguise
rest peace leader jackson 5
died sleep im still big pimpin
ball mall beginning ending
fuck sun
momma look ya son
happened smile
tears tatted rag pocket
im looking love know somebody got it
champagne pain weed low
god damn im high fuck go
im losing im stuck moment
look mirror opponent
fuck press fuck press
either know dont care im fucking depressed
crying public lying judges
risking life im already dying fuck well
welcome jungle welcome jungle well
goddammit
