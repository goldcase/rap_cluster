"christmas in harlem"
(feat. teyana taylor, cyhi da prince)
christmas in harlem
right after autumn falls
soaking it all in
then we go hit the mall
even though we ain't balling
feels like we bought it all
the mistletoe's right here
come give a kiss to santa claus
merry christmas to all, and all a good night
huh, now we all living the good life
yeah, though it's forty below the wind chill
and we wiping snow up off the windshield
it's still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
and i'm, so happy i'm with my baby
and we a lil late with the christmas gifts
rushing for the mall, don't trip, you know i drive crazy
the streets lit up, it feel like christmas officially
told her that "you the star at the top of my christmas tree"
my only question is, "where my presents?"
she said, "shhh," she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see
well, i like the way you think, mami
now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami
got a surprise for you that ain't on your christmas list-es
gave her the hot chocolate, she said "it's d-ricious"
christmas in harlem
right after autumn falls
soaking it all in
then we go hit the mall (i'm like bad santa, though)
even though we ain't balling (you might have to sit on my lap)
feels like we bought it all (ho, ho, ho)
the mistletoe's right here
come give a kiss to santa claus
first, i wanted to say merry christmas to y'all
for santa claus, so bake a turkey, burn a few logs
i be there soon, on my sled, me and rudolph
thugs think i'm a blood 'cause i won't take this red suit off
ha, i swear i got the freshest wardrobe
i let my beard grow 'cause it's cold in the north pole
her voice slow 'cause "i always got a sore throat"
okay, stop it, no more jokes
you never see me 'cause i shop when the stores close
and my sleigh go faster than the porsche go
ha, i got nine reindeers
that's dancer, that's prancer on the fourth flo'
that's comet, that's cupid, that's vixen
that's donner, that's dasher, that's blitzen
happy kwanzaa, and for the ones that aren't christian
everybody gets gifts as long as i'm living
so look forward to having
christmas in harlem
right after autumn falls
soaking it all in
then we go hit the mall
even though we ain't balling
feels like we bought it all
the mistletoe's right here
come give a kiss to santa claus
all the flashing lights up on a tree
the house lit up nice
with your family's where you wanna be
here on christmas night
when you wake up and you see the gifts
don't that make you feel good?
so since we all snowed in in harlem
let's have christmas in the hoo-hood
all of the flashing lights
yeah, when they shine so bright
always for you and me
baby, you're christmas eve
if you like what you see me
won't you come sit on my knee?
tell me everything that you want
cause, baby, i'm your santa claus
christmas in harlem
right after autumn falls
soaking it all in
then we go hit the mall
even though we ain't balling
feels like we bought it all
the mistletoe's right here
come give a kiss to santa claus
i peeped it, you know what?
need some reindeer for this one
i wanna hear sleigh bells on this one
got a new suit on this one
the newborn look too cute for this one
yeah, the new winter coat for this one
yeah, gotta let it snow on this one
huh, all the christmas cheer for this one
the whole family up in here on this one
yeah
christmas in harlem
right after autumn falls
soaking it all in
then we gon' hit the mall
even though we ain't balling
feels like we bought it all
the mistletoe's right here
come give a kiss to santa claus
(au, au, au, au, au...)
