"family business"
how's your son? (all, all, all the things, things)
he make the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)
aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?
(all, all, all the glitter is not gold)
yeah me we gon' cook this up (now gold is not a reality)
(real is what you live to be)
this is family business
and this is for the family that can't be with us
and this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
that's why i spit it in my songs so sweet
like a photo of your granny's picture
now that you're gone it hit us
super hard on thankgiving and christmas, this can't be right
yeah you heard the track i did man, this can't be life
somebody please say grace so i can save face
and have a reason to cover my face
i even made you a plate, soul food, know how granny do it
monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
when i brought it why had guard have to look all to it?
as kids we used to laugh
who knew that life would move this fast?
who knew i'd have to look at you through a glass?
and look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it
and if you did, then that's family business
and i don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
they don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
all these fancy things
i tell you that all (all the glitter) my weight in gold
now all i know i know all these things
this is family business
and this is for everybody standin' with us
come on, let's take a family grammy picture
abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?
now she like "see, that's my cousin on tv"
now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
and y'all gon' hate it and i'm his favorite
i can't deny it, i'm a straight rider
but when we get together be electric slidin'
grandma, get 'em shook up
aw naw, don't open the photo book up
i got an aunt ruth that can't remember your name
but i bet them polaroids'll send her down memory lane
you know that one auntie, you don't wanna be rude
but every holiday nobody eatin' her food
and you don't wanna stay there cuz them your worst cousins
got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
fit three in the bed while six of y'all
i'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
but you ain't have to tell my girl i used to pee in the bed
rain, rain, rain go away
let the sun come out and all the children say
rain, rain, rain go away
let the sun come out and all the children say
i woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
a creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns
keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to god
and keep your face to the risin' sun
all my niggas from the chi, that's my family dog
and my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
i feel like one day you'll understand me dog
you can still love your man and be manly dog
you ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
sittin' here, grillin' people like george foreman
why uncle ray and aunt shiela always performin'?
the second she storms out then he storms in
y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
and drink some wine like communion
and act like everything fine and if it isn't
we ain't lettin' everybody in our family business
(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
they don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
they don't mean a thing
(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
they don't mean a thing, a thing
and i don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
they don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
all these fancy things
i tell you that all (all the glitter) my weight in gold
now all i know i know all these things
(oooh) all these things (these things)
all these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
all these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
all these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
all these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
all these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
all these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
all these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
