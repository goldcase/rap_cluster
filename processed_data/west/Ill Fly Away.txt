"i'll fly away" lyrics
kanye west lyrics
"i'll fly away"
some glad morning when this life is over,
i'll fly away.
to a home on god's celestial shore,
i'll fly away.
i'll fly away, o glory,
i'll fly away.
when i die, hallelujah, bye and bye,
i'll fly away.
when the shadows of this life have flown,
i'll fly away.
like a bird thrown, driven by the storm,
i'll fly away.
i'll fly away, o glory,
i'll fly away.
when i die, hallelujah, bye and bye,
i'll fly away.
just a few more weary days and then,
i'll fly away.
to a land where joy shall never end,
i'll fly away.
i'll fly away, o glory,
i'll fly away.
when i die, hallelujah, bye and bye,
i'll fly away.
