street lights lyrics
kanye west lyrics
street lights
let know
still got time grow
things aint always set stone
known let know
let me
seems like street lights glowin
happen like moments passin
front hopped cab and
paid fare see know destination
im there
streets glowin
happen like moments passin
front hopped cab and
paid fare see know destination
im there
streets
streets
im streets
im there
lifes fair
seems like street lights glowin
happen like moments passin
front hopped cab and
paid fare see know destination
im there
street lights glowin
happen like moments passin
front hopped cab and
paid fare see know destination
im there
street lights glowin
happen like moments passin
front hopped cab and
paid fare see know destination
im there
streets
streets
im streets
im there
lifes fair
lifes fair
