"two words"
(feat. mos def, freeway, the harlem boys choir)
we in the streets playa, getcha mail
it's only two places you'll end up - either dead or in jail
still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go
now throw ya hands up bustless, bustas, boostas, hoes
everybody, fuck that
still nowhere to go...sill nowhere to go..
two words, united states, no love, no brakes
low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks
big macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules
presidential scandals, everybody move
two words, mos def, k west, hot shit
calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
game ball, lock shit, dump off, cock shit
we won't stop shit, everybody move
two words, bk , ny, bedstuy
two hawks, too hungry, too many, that's why
these streets know game, can't ball, don't play
every traffic, one lane, everybody move
two words, mos def, black check, hot shit
calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
game point lock, long pump cocked
we won't stop, everybody move
- now throw ya hands up bustless, bustas (throw your hands up high)
boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (ohhhhhh)
still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go... (ohhhhhh)
- and keep ya hands up bustless, bustas (till they reach the sky)
boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (ohhhhhh)
still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go... (ohhhhhh)
aiyyo, two words, chi town, south side, world wide
cuz i, rep that, till i, fuckin die
one neck, two chains, one waist, two gats
one wall, twenty plaques, dudes say, "gimme that"
i am limelight, blueprint, 5 mics
go getters rhyme like, shoulda been signed twice
most imitated, grammy nominated
hotel accommodated, cheerleader, prom dated
barbershop, playa hated, mom and pop, bootlegged it
felt like it rained till the roof caved in
two words, chi town, raised me, crazy
so i live by two words, "fuck you, pay me"
screamin, jesus save me
you know how the game be
i can't let em change me
cuz on judgment day, you gon blame me
look god, it's the same me
i (throw) basically know now (your) we could (up) racially profile (high)
cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and hoe down (ohhhhhh)
plus i got a whole city to hold down (ohhhhhh)
from the bottom to the top
the only place to go down
two words, freeway, two letters, a-r
turn y'all rap niggaz into two words, fast runners
like jackie jurner, you better sleep with your burner
the heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car
my god, two words, no guns, break arms
break necks, break backs, steven segul
free...young bars, fresh men of the roc
left the beef in the pot jay sent for his dogs
and broads, forget ya squad, let em find for yourself
have you screamin out four words "send for the lord"
two words, freeway's slightly retarded
fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad..
