kanye west lyrics
flashing lights
feat dwele
flashing lights lights
flashing lights lights
flashing lights lights
flashing lights lights
dont believe shootin stars
believe shoes  cars
wood floors new apartment
couture stores department
like leau de stardee shit
im trips florida
order horderves views water
straight page favorite author
weather breezy
man cant life always easy
mirror dancing sleazy
get call like yeezy
try hit oeur de whopee
till get flashed paparazzi
damn niggas got me
hate niggas nazis
recall know love show off
never thought would take far
know flashing lights lights
know flashing lights lights
know while
sweetheart hardly talk thing
know foul baybay
abay lately brain
somebody wouldve told month ago
fronting though yo wouldnt wanna know
somebody wouldve told year ago
itd go get difficult
feeling like katrina fema
like martin gina
like flight visa
first class seat back still see ya
past side glass
memorys museum
im saying hey mona lisa
come home know cant rome without caesar
recall know love show off
never thought would take far
know flashing lights lights
know flashing lights lights
recall know love show off
never thought would take far
know flashing lights lights
know flashing lights lights
flashing lights lights
flashing lights lights
lights lights lights lights
