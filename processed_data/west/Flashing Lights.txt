"flashing lights"
(feat. dwele)
flashing lights, lights
flashing lights, lights
flashing lights, lights
flashing lights, lights
she don't believe in shootin' stars,
but she believe in shoes & cars
wood floors in the new apartment,
couture from the store's department
you more like l'eau de stardee shit,
i'm more of the, trips to florida
order the h'orderves, views of the water
straight from the page of your favorite author
and the weather so breezy,
man why can't life always be this easy
she in the mirror dancing so sleazy,
i get a call like where are you yeezy
try to hit you with a 'oeur de whopee'
till i get flashed by the paparazzi
damn, these nigga's got me,
i hate these nigga's more than the nazis
as i recall, i know you love to show off
but i never thought that you would take it this far
what do i know? flashing lights, lights
what do i know? flashing lights, lights
i know it's been a while,
sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, i was doing my thing
i know i was foul bay-bay,
a-bay late-ly you been all on my brain,
and if somebody would've told me a month ago
fronting though, yo i wouldn't wanna know
if somebody would've told me a year ago
it'd go, get this difficult
feeling like katrina with no fema
like martin with no gina
like a flight with no visa
first class with the seat back i still see ya
in my past, you on the other side of the glass
of my memory's museum,
i'm just saying, hey mona lisa,
come home you know you can't rome without caesar
as i recall, i know you love to show off
but i never thought that you would take it this far
what do i know? flashing lights, lights
what do i know? flashing lights, lights
as you recall, you know i love to show off
but you never thought that i would take it this far
what do you know? flashing lights, lights
what do you know? flashing lights, lights
flashing lights, lights
flashing lights, lights
lights, lights, lights, lights...
