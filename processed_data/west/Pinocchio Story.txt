"pinocchio story"
wise men say
wise men say
wise men say
the baddest niggas out there bro
never figure out real love
you'll never figure out real love
you'll never figure out real love
its so crazy
i got everything figured out
but for some reason i can never find what real love is about
no doubt
everything in the world figured out but i can never seem to find what real love is about
do you think i sacrificed real life
for all the fame of flashing lights?
do you think i sacrifice a real life
for all the fame of flashing lights?
there is no gucci i can buy
there is no louis vuitton to put on
there is no ysl that they could sell
to get my heart out of this hell
and my mind out of this jail
there is no clothes that i could buy
that could turn back the time
there is no vacation spot i could fly
that could bring back a piece of real life
real life, what does it feel like?
i ask you tonight, i ask you tonight
what does it feel like, i ask you tonight
to live a real life
i just want to be a real boy
they always say kanye, he keeps it real boy
pinocchio story is, i just want to be a real boy
pinocchio story is to be a real boy
its funny pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it
i tell the truth and i keep running
its like i'm looking for something out there trying to find something
i turn on the tv and see me and see nothing
what does it feel like to live real life to be real?
not some facade on tv that no can really feel
do you really have the stamina...
for everybody that sees you and that say 'where's my camera?'
for everybody that sees you and says 'sign my autograph'
for everybody that sees you and says that 'you all that'
you all that
i just want to be a real boy,
pinocchio story goes, i just want to be a real boy
pinocchio story goes...
and there is no gepetto to guide me, no one right beside me
the only one was behind me i cant find her no more,
i cant find her no more i cant...
the only one that come out on the tour and stay, stay, stay...
back when i was living at home and this was all a big dream
and the fame will be got caught
and the day i moved to la
maybe that was all my fault
all my fault to be a real boy
chasing the american dream,
chasing everything we seen
up on the tv screen
and when i- the benz was left
and the clothes was left
and the hoes was left
you talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-
you spent the doughs to death
and tell me what-tf for a real boy
they say kanye you keep it too real boy
perspective and wise man say, one day you'll find your way
the wise man say, you'll find your way
the wise man say, you'll find your way
the wise man say
