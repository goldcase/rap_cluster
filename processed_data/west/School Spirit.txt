told 'em i finished school, and i started my own business
they say, 'oh you graduated?'

chasin' y'all dreams and what you've got planned
now i spit it so hot you got tanned
back to school and i hate it there, i hate it there
everything i want i gotta wait a year, i wait a year
this nigga graduated at the top of my class..
i went to cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there
i got a jones like norah for your sorror'
bring more of them girls i've seen in the aurora
tammy, becky, and laura, or'a shirley
i'm tryin' to hit it early, like i'm in a hurry
see, that's how dude became the young pootie tang tippy tow
rocafella chain, yeah that's my rapper style
rosary piece, yeah that's my catholic style
red and white one's, yeah that's my kappa style
and i ain't even pledge
crack my head on the steering wheel and i ain't even dead
if i could go through all that and still be breathing
bitch bend over, i'm here for a reason
i feel a woo coming on, cuz. i feel a woo coming on, cuz

a couple woos coming on, cuz. a couple woos coming on, cuz
woo, woo
