lupe fiasco lyrics
"us placers"
(performed as child rebel soldier)
(with kanye west, pharrell)
life styles of the rich and famous
bought a big house and a whole lotta rangers
fresh new couch and a whole lotta trainers
a closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers
and some mexican floral arrangers
a great big tv that'll entertain us
some colourful commissions for some high paid painters
someone to take the wrap so that i stay stainless
and a new relationship with a banker
and two pinky rings for my manicured fingers
a trained german shepard that bark when he's angered
to watch my possessions and to look out for strangers
and a fifty foot yacht with an anchor
a young supermodel that should remain nameless
(the) ups and the downs the sames and the changes
all the money in the world won't make it painless no...
(but they love it and they love it)
the more you try to erase me
(and they love it)
the more the more
the more that i appear
oh, the more the more (and they love it)
the more you try the eraser
the more the more (and they love it)
the more that you appear
(plain pat, what up?)
lifestyles of the broke and famous
let you know how crazy this game is
look at all the new beautiful faces
at home supermodel myspaces
long for they shot on the tv screen
american idol never seen these dreams
just last week they wanna see id
now they got you in vip huh
how many people almost famous
you almost remember what they name is
like hey didn't you play in
no it couldn't be quit playin
now tryin to keep that balance
after mtv that's a real world challenge
back on that train
never to be heard from again
(but they love it and they love it)
the more you try to erase me
the more the more (and they love it)
the more that i appear
oh, the more the more (and they love it)
the more you try the eraser
the more the more (and they love it)
the more that you appear
g r i p p i m p
i any spell a bitch come on that's me
i bring a burner sensation to the urban eye
like a eye drop of turpentine
you can listen to the serpent fine
but the earth got gas once it burps its fine
some around me they talk about degrees
now ghg how to cook a quart of ki
talkin bout nasal he ain't over that cold
no glove, scrub, man he's just over that stove
perfect paradigm wrong place wrong time
shoulda been phizer glaxo smith kline
number one chemist look at the no blemish
egg shell off white like a dupont finish
young, dumb, how strong who can handle us?
i wonder how god's goin paint today's canvases
cause who knew that day that man would just
go to va with a tech and spray campuses
what a way to see the cover of time
i know that n**** wish he was standing in line
to see it..as if he didn't do it
(but they love it and they love it)
the more you try the erase me
the more the more (and they love it)
the more that i appear
oh, the more the more (and they love it)
the more you try the eraser
the more the more (and they love it)
the more that you appear
