us placers lyrics
lupe fiasco lyrics
us placers
performed child rebel soldier
kanye west pharrell
life styles rich famous
bought big house whole lotta rangers
fresh new couch whole lotta trainers
closet full clothes brand new dangers
mexican floral arrangers
great big tv thatll entertain us
colourful commissions high paid painters
someone take wrap stay stainless
new relationship banker
two pinky rings manicured fingers
trained german shepard bark hes angered
watch possessions look strangers
fifty foot yacht anchor
young supermodel remain nameless
ups downs sames changes
money world wont make painless no
love love it
try erase me
love
more
appear
oh love
try eraser
love
appear
plain pat up
lifestyles broke famous
let know crazy game is
look new beautiful faces
home supermodel myspaces
long shot tv screen
american idol never seen dreams
last week wanna see id
got vip huh
many people almost famous
almost remember name is
like hey didnt play in

tryin keep balance

love love it

oh love

spell bitch come thats me
bring burner sensation urban eye
like eye drop turpentine
listen serpent fine
earth got gas burps fine
around talk degrees

talkin bout nasal aint cold

egg shell white like dupont finish
young dumb strong handle us
wonder gods goin paint todays canvases
cause knew day man would just
go va tech spray campuses

love love it
try erase me
love

oh love
try eraser
