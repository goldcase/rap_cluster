"impossible"
(feat. twista, keyshia cole)
i've been waiting my life; and i stayed on my grind
now i made up my mind; it's been way too much time
that's why...it's just impossible - it's im-poss-ible
and you know that...
i don't wanna hear that bull sh..; i wanna hear that official sh..,
kanye and that twista sh..; that's so impossible to get it (it's just impossible)
get it, that's so impossible to get it, get it, that's so impossible to get it (it's impossible)
aint no way you could pull up to the party in a bentley blowing b in a club like this; (oh no)
aint no way you could cook up in the studio with kanye and get it jukking in the club like this (oh no)
aint no way that you could win; dust some haters off while i'm sippin on my 'hen,
holla at a chick while she sippin on her gin
and i got the mobsters hollering at her friends, (its impossible)
for you to ever be the nicest; you aint get gangsta or get righteous,
you aint neva stood on a tip like this; you aint neva stood for no sh.. like this, (its just impossible)
for you to get it if you don't wanna win; so get up off ya ass
and go for yours
and neva for mine
now you aint from the ride that i'm in
know what i'm
sayin...
it's impossible for you to eva get wit me because of how i ride on the track;
got the bitch in the back of the billy yo? when my celeb
used to have the bitch in the back of the cadillac (it's just impossible)
niggas always hatin
leaving me for wilin out for po kim
you be sittin back talking yo shit
i cant help but i see you tho, i don't get it (its impossible)
lil mama, for you to fit all that up in a pants; booty kinda wide
turn a regular jeans in a low riders
tell me can i be your man  (its just impossible)
for you to eva deny, that i'm about chi-town
represent the city with the deal for 12 years and sell a couple a mil and still hold it down...that's possible
get it; bundled up and - lit it; smoke a lil blunt don't - admit it
do it like i did too late - i did it
the controversy cant worse me man; i'm eating but i'm still thirsty and
thirsty what is you saying
i gotta a duel with a couple niggas that's thursday man
why the hell is i'm worrying; hopping out the benz with the perfect 10
man your life must be perfect man; look at how they came up with the perfect plan
its impossible
got strip clubs playin gosspital
girl so sick in the hospital
you know i jumped out like pakadu
i only break it down i when i rock wit you
since michael jackson made rock wit you
i done did shit on logical
maybe cause we did the impossible
maybe we done did the impossible
no matter what i do, see i been waitin all my, waitin all my life, yeah,
and i know i stayed on my grind, i know i stayed on my grind,
its impossible for me to fail baby, i gotta keep on movin,
gotta keep on movin, its impossible
(its just impossible) (its impossible)
