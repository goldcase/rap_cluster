"lost in the world"
(feat. justin vernon of bon iver)
i'm up in the woods, i'm down on my mind
i'm building a still to slow down the time
i'm up in the woods, i'm down on my mind
i'm building a still to slow down the time
i'm up in the woods, i'm down on my mind
i'm building a still to slow down the time
i'm lost in the world, i'm down on my mind
i'm new in the city, and i'm down for the night
down for the night
said she's down for the night
you're my devil, you're my angel
you're my heaven, you're my hell
you're my now, you're my forever
you're my freedom, you're my jail
you're my lies, you're my truth
you're my war, you're my truce
you're my questions, you're my proof
you're my stress and you're my masseuse
mama-say mama-say ma-ma-coo-sah
lost in this plastic life,
let's break out of this fake ass party
turn this into a classic night
if we die in each other's arms we still get laid in the afterlife
if we die in each other's arms we still get laid
(i'm lost in the world)
run from the lights, run from the night,
(i'm down on my mind)
run for your life,
i'm new in the city, and i'm down for the night
down for the night
down for the night
i'm lost in the world, been down for my whole life,
i'm new in the city but i'm down for the night
down for the night
down for the night
who will survive in america?
who will survive in america?
who will survive in america?
i'm lost in the world, i'm down on my mind
i'm new in the city, and i'm down for the night
down for the night
said she's down for the night
i'm lost in the world, i'm down on my mind
i'm new in the city and i'm goin' for a ride
goin' for a ride
i'm lost in the world, been down for my whole life
i'm new in the city but i'm down the for the night
down for a night, down for a good time
us living as we do upside down.
and the new word to have is revolution.
people don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel because god's whole card has been thoroughly piqued.
and america is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey.
the youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night digging paul revere and nat turner as the good guys.
america stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes.
the signs of truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina.
we learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal.
two long centuries buried in the musty vault, hosed down daily with a gagging perfume.
america was a bastard, the illegitimate daughter of the mother country whose legs were then spread around the world and a rapist known as freedom, free doom.
democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling in the mother country's crotch
what does webster say about soul?
all i want is a good home and a wife
and our children and some food to feed them every night.
after all is said and done build a new route to china if they'll have you.
who will survive in america?
who will survive in america?
who will survive in america?
who will survive in america?
