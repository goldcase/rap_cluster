"see me now"
(feat. beyoncé, charlie wilson)
i know you see me now right now
(i know you see me now right now)
i know you see me now right now
(you see)
i know you see me now right now
(right now)
i know you see me now right now
i got my suit and tie
and i don’t know if y’all know
well, maybe y’all do
or maybe y’all don’t
but i don’t really care
it’s how we on it all the time
so i’ma get my money
let’s go
now, i’ma need you to kill the hypocrisy
this is an aristocracy
i’m socrates, but my skin more chocolately
what’s up with who? that’s old news
i’m in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
huh? i swear my whole collection’s so cool
i might walk in nobu with no shoes
he just walked in nobu like it was whole foods!
that nigga crazy, i told you!
immature adult (uh huh), insecure asshole (what else?)
and if you fall on the concrete, that’s yo’ ass fault
if you pass on a kon beat, that’s yo’ last fault
get what you ask for, i swear that’s yo’ ass, so
she got a big booty, but she couldn’t drop that ass low
‘til you take yo’ last ho, and rope up all the cash flow
when you gettin’ money, they be all up on yo’ ass, yo
when you gettin’ money kons don’t let a nigga pass go
straight to jail, yo, in a hell hole
right next to lucifer, tell ‘em i say hello
ask him if i’ma be there soon and tell ‘im i said “hell, no!”
yo, what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?
my niggas is home
i guess i got everything
everything i want
(lets go shopping dog, lets celebrate)
but i don’t
no matter how good it gets
(free weezy though)
it’ll never be like before
no women in the crowd
screamin’ and it’s loud
doin’ things not allowed
and i swear it’s goin’ down right now
(you know what it is)
i know one thing, my mama would be proud
and you see me lookin’ up
‘cause i know she’s lookin’ down right now
i know you see me now right now
(i know you see me now right now)
i know you see me now right now
(right now, right now)
i know you see me now right now
(right now)
i know you see me now right now
pour the champagne, let your watch show
shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal
i admit my first watch was a fossil
now i’m in the louvre, lookin’ for fossils
attention to detail is so uncanny
and the whip’s on the sprewells, it’s so un-camry
somebody need to put us on camera
the world of rollies and everyone families
stay jordan fresh, suits and ferrari’s
cute, your shorty watch barneys, we at de bonny’s
end up at marley, georgi, and service from sergio
da kine lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
i know the flow just hit a hellafied vertical
this the christ year, last year was magic, thirty-two
lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder ‘ye
‘cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
i got styled last june and she heard of me
i killed the fur last paris, raised the murder rate
first of all, we all know the beats is
like a mix between fergie and jesus
imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
every one of his majesty’s swim parties is paegantries
cannonball off the diving board when i am board
all my homies gd’s, but i am lord
rap god, greek mythology
and this life too crazy to think logically
here’s something that you could use in analogy
my life is like a child’s illusions become reality
now go get my throne
‘cause i don’t wanna stop
i just go in my zone
and i’ma make it hot
‘til it’s time to go
when it’s time to go
where you tryna go?
you better act like you can see me now
(exactly!)
i know you see me now right now
(i know you see me now right now)
i know you see me now right now
(right now, right now)
i know you see me now right now
(right now)
i know you see me now right now
i know you see me
i know you see me
i know you see me
it’s like i’m 3d
i know you see me now right now
(i know you see me now right now)
i know you see me now right now
(right now, right now)
i know you see me now right now
(right now)
i know you see me now right now
i know you see me
i know you see me
i know you see me
it’s like i’m 3d
i know you see me now right now
(i know you see me now right now)
i know you see me now right now
(right now, right now)
i know you see me now right now
(right now)
i know you see me now right now
hey, feel like one of those old r. kelly joints, right?
i bet they put me back on the cover of ebony now
i know jet magazine callin’ right now
you lookin’ good today, too
i like that
you got your new suit on
and she got the extra cute on
i know you thinkin’ “this that yeezy we all love”
i’m back, baby
we back, baby!
uncle charlie, by the way
and i’mma let you finish, but i got beyonce on the track
that’s what it is
black excellence, baby
we the elite
we the greatest in the world!
we the greatest in the world!
