"lift off"
(with jay-z)
(feat. beyonce)
(all engines running)
we gon’ take it to the moon, take it to the stars
how many people you know can take it this far?
i’m supercharged
i’m ’bout to take this whole thing to mars
now we gon’ take it to the moon, take it to the stars
you don’t know what we been through to make it this far
so many scars
‘bout to take this whole thing to mars
lift off
lift off, takin’ my coat off
showin’ my tattoos, i’m such a showoff (huh?)
i feel the pain and then rolled off
i got the whole city, they about to go off
how many niggas wit’ me up in this bitch?
how many people wanna roll with me now?
like you know na na na, you know me by now
know me, know me by now
we gon’ take it to the moon, take it to the stars
how many people you know can take it this far?
i’m supercharged
i’m ’bout to take this whole thing to mars
now we gon’ take it to the moon, take it to the stars
you don’t know what we been through to make it this far
so many scars
‘bout to take this whole thing to mars
(lift off, ahh, ahh)
like you know na na na, you know me by now
know me, know me by now
you know me know me by now
know me, know me by now…
lift off
rappers hear watch the throne
they gon be pissed off
earth is boring to em
shit is making my dick soft
when you earnhart as me eventually you hit a big wall
5-4-3-2 we need fuel
lift off
we gon’ take it to the moon, take it to the stars
how many people you know can take it this far?
i’m supercharged
i’m ’bout to take this whole thing to mars
now we gon’ take it to the moon, take it to the stars
you don’t know what we been through to make it this far
so many scars
‘bout to take this whole thing to mars
