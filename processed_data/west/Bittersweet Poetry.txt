bittersweet poetry
feat john mayer
bittersweet
youre gonna death me
dont want need you
love hate time
bittersweet
see want much shit never hurt bad
never thats virgin says
weve generally warned thats surgeon says
god talk emergency
claim currency
cut deep bitch cut like surgery
proud admit hurting me
id never least purposely
breaking making again
dont love guess fucking then
ever felt ever want kill her
mix emotions tequila
mix little bad advice
one bad nights yall bad fight
talking bout family aunts shit
say motherfucker yo mommas bitch
know domestic drama shit attitude
ill never hit girl ill shake shit outta you
imma bigger man big pimpin like jiggaman
oh guess figure its
see want much shit never hurt bad
never thats virgin says
weve generally warned thats surgeon says
god talk emergency
nigga said shouldnt let worry me
need focus girls getting currently
thinking got back sinking and
relationship even got back drinking this
hennessy
gonna death me
always thought child destiny
cant even vibe sexually
cuz every time would try would question me
saying fucking girls disrespecting me
dont see ya lies affecting me
dont see life supposed be
never let nigga get close me
aint cracked supposed be
always gone youll always hoesll be
first time ever spilled soul me
fucked know g
guess bittersweet poetry
see want much shit never hurt bad
never thats virgin says
weve generally warned thats surgeon says
god talk emergency
