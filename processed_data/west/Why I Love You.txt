love lyrics
kanye west lyrics
love you
jayz
feat mr hudson
ooh love so
love you
i’ll never know
picture throne burning
rome burning i’m sitting corner alone burning
always end like this
something don’t determine
people fought for
fight ride for
live die for
reason niggas alive for
want dead
i’m sorry can’t die you
make em put hands sky you
waiting fireworks like july 4th
get fly get high cry boy for
grief beef i’ll fly easter’s over
tried teach niggas kings
ever wanted soldiers
love gone til blood drawn
longer wear uniform
fuck squares circle got smaller
castle got bigger walls got taller
truth told said
niggas still got love you
ooh love so
love you
i’ll never know
showed love niggas
ripped heart stepped it
picked pieces swept it
god damn shit leaves mess don’t it
shit feelin’ like death don’t it
charge game whatever’s left it
spent minute maybe less it
fly pelican fly turn jets it
first shall digress it
wasn’t good king
maybe much good thing huh
didn’t spoil money loyal to
huh gave loyalty
made royalty royalties
took care niggas lawyer fees
niggas rewardin’ me
damn
ooh love so
love you
i’ll never know
bussin’ bbbbussin’ me
i’m bullet proof bitch can’t get nothin’ past me
got body armor nigga gotta watch throne
i’m bussin’ back niggas glass house throw stones
love turns hate
gotta separate fuckin’ fakes
caesar didn’t see ceased exist
nigga killed keys shit
brother’s keeper
nigga don’t creep up
got pistol pillow
i’ve never deep sleeper
pppparanoia
cause nigga said he’ll…
blast ya now…
blastin’ ya that’s assassin ya
niggas got shot they’ll shoot
please lord forgive him
niggas know ooh
