sin city lyrics
kanye west lyrics
sin city
performed john legend teyana taylor cyhi prynce malik yusef
feat travis scott
10 west side bitch
see glasses obvious
run home tonight here
dont go home cause ran there
drunken nights fuckin every night
run mouth cant eat right
dont read line forgot white
smelled line baby know dont need white
look cops behind us
ran red light mindless
smh know cocaine killed abel
scholar letters devour this
stepped hell cause winter got cold
dont look eyes might see straight soul
dont say yes good cause youll never know
cause lost city sin biggy
im open arms gotta
heart belongs
heart belongs me
heart
im wont go
without heart belongs
me
heart
beg mercy today
wont take away
take away you
dont know would do
dont let us die vain
dont let see pain
wash demons away
wash demons away
unwelcome sin city
yet population still increases density
increases intensity
increases propensity
complicate simplicity
matter ethnicity
sake publicity city
huh bad bitches ass shots
use house stash spot
lexus coupe ragtop
im loop warm tie like ascot
used run havenots
kept ave hot could knots
lot niggaz see dreams glass pot
judge throw box watch ass rot
broke commandments
authentic im handstitched
come spend day hamlet
city lost say atlantis
went cannes tan bitch francis
rode broom beach thats sand witch
ate like haters hate like it
sex drugs playin dices favorite vices
lifell take toll ya
well guess gotta pay prices
know christ is
never hung saints makes sense save righteous
age ten caged in
raise men state pen
fake friends forgive em sins
god bless city amen
im one residents
walk none repercuss decadence
fuckin debauchery
adult film star somebodys fuckin watchin me
always feel like im almost feel like
cause could feel air tonight
wrongs wouldnt dare right
wrote songs wouldnt dare recite
willing share tonight
city unfair life
