(feat. travis scott)
10 a.m. it's west side bitch
she see the glasses, so obvious
run from home, after tonight we up out of here
don't go home cause they just ran me up out of there
all of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night
she run her mouth, but can't eat right
don't read between the line and forgot how to be white
she smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white
now look what we did now, the cops behind us
ran that red light, did you have to be mindless?
smh, we all know that cocaine killed abel
from the scholar letters devour this
she stepped into hell, cause winter got cold
don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul
don't say yes to that good, cause you'll never know
cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy
i'm here with open arms and i gotta
here is where her heart belongs
her heart belongs to me
here is where her heart
i'm here and i won't go
without her, this is where her heart belongs
it should be here with me
here is where her heart
i beg for mercy today
they won't take me away
take me away from you
don't know what i would do
don't let us die in vain
don't let them see our pain
wash these demons away
wash these demons away
you are all unwelcome to sin city
yet the population still increases its density
and that increases its intensity
which increases the propensity
to complicate your simplicity
no matter your ethnicity
all for the sake of publicity, in this city
huh, bad bitches with ass shots
use a house as a stash spot
lexus coupe with the rag-top
i'm in the loop, warm tie like a ascot
i used to run with the have-nots
kept the ave hot just so we could have knots
a lot of niggaz see they dreams in a glass pot
until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot
we broke all the commandments
authentic, i'm hand-stitched
come spend a day in my hamlet
my city lost, some say it's atlantis
i went to cannes with a tan bitch, francis
she rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch
so i ate her like it, haters hate to like it
sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices
but this life'll take a toll on ya
well i guess you gotta pay the prices
i know who christ is
and he never hung with the saints it makes no sense to save the righteous
by the age ten, we were caged in
now they raise men in the state pen
fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins
god bless the city, amen
and now i'm one of the residents
they walk with none of the repercuss', but all of the decadence
and all the fuckin' debauchery
adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me
i always feel like, i'm almost feel like
cause i could feel it in the air tonight
i did some wrongs i wouldn't dare to right
and wrote some songs i wouldn't dare recite
but i am willing to share tonight
in the city that is as unfair as life
