"good life"
(feat. t-pain)
like we always do at this time
i go for mine, i got to shine
now throw your hands up in the sky
i g-go for mine, i got to shine
now throw your hands up in the sky
i'm gonna get on this tv mama, i'm gonna
i'm gonna put shit down
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
hey, i'm good
welcome to the good life
where niggas that sell d
won't even get pulled over in they new v
the good life, let's go on a living' spree
shit they say the best things in life are free
the good life, it feel like atlanta
it feel like l.a., it feel like miami
it feel like n.y., summertime chi, ah
(now throw your hands up in the sky)
so i roll through good
y'all pop the trunk, i pop the hood, ferrari
and she got the goods
and she got that ass, i got to look, sorry
yo it's got to be cause i'm seasoned
haters give me them salty looks, lawry's
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
and if they hate then let 'em hate
and watch the money pile up, the good life
now i, i go for mine, i got to shine
now throw your hands up in the sky
now i, i go for mine, i got to shine
now throw your hands up in the sky
welcome to the good life
where we like the girls who ain't on tv
cause they got more (ass than the models)
the good life, so keep it coming' with the bottles
till she feel boozed like she bombed out apollo
the good life, it feel like houston
it feel like philly, it feel like d.c.
it feel like va, or the bay, or ye
ayy, this is the good life
welcome to the good life
homie, tell me what's good
why i only got a problem when you in the hood
like i'm new in the hood, the only thing i wish?
(i wish a nigga would)
he probably think he could, but, but
i don't think he should
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
and if they hate then let 'em hate
and watch the money pile up, the good life
have you ever popped champagne on a plane
while getting' some brain
whipped it out, she said "i never seen snakes on a plane"
whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz
having' money's not everything, not having it is
i was splurging' on trizz
but when i get my card back activated
i'm back to vegas cause
i always had a passion for flashing' before i had it
i close my eyes and imagine, the good life
is the good life better than the life i live
when i thought that i was gonna go crazy
and now my grandmama ain't the only girl calling me baby
and if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky
and let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh
i'm good
