"all of the lights"
(feat. john legend, the-dream, elly jackson, alicia keys, fergie, kid cudi, elton john, rihanna)
all of the lights
all of the lights
all of the lights
all of the lights
turn up the lights in here, baby
extra bright, i want y'all to see this
turn up the lights in here, baby
you know what i need
want you to see everything
want you to see all of the lights
(all of the lights)
fast cars, shooting stars
(all of the lights, all of the lights)
until it's vegas everywhere we are
(all of the lights, all of the lights)
if you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
something wrong
i hold my head
mj gone, our nigga dead!
i slapped my girl, she called the feds
i did that time and spent that bread
i’m heading home, i’m almost there
i’m on my way heading up the stairs
to my surprise a nigga replacing me
i had to take 'em to that ghetto university
all of the lights
cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
strobe lights, street lights
all of the lights
all of the lights
fast life, drug life
thug life, rock life
every night
(all of the lights)
turn up the lights in here, baby
extra bright, i want y'all to see this
turn up the lights in here, baby
you know what i need
want you to see everything
want you to see all of the lights
restraining order
can’t see my daughter
her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
public visitation
we met at borders
told her she take me back
i’ll be more supportive
i made mistakes
i bump my head
courts suck me dry
i spent that bread
she need a daddy
baby please, can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university
all of the lights
cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
strobe lights, street lights
all of the lights
all of the lights
fast life, drug life
thug life, rock life
every night
(all of the lights)
turn up the lights in here, baby
extra bright, i want y'all to see this
turn up the lights in here, baby
you know what i need
want you to see everything
want you to see all of the lights
getting mine, baby
gotta let these niggas know, yeah
get it right, ay
you should go and get your own
getting mine, baby
gotta let these niggas know, yeah
get it right, ay
you should go and get your own
unemployment line, credit card declined
did i not mention i was about to lose my mind?
(my mind, my mind, my mind)
and also was about to do that line
okay, okay, you know we going all the way this time
(this time, this time, this time)
we going all the way this time
(time, time, time, time)
we going all the way this time
we going all the way this time
we going all the way this time
we going all the way this time
turn up the lights in here, baby
extra bright, i want y'all to see this
turn up the lights in here, baby
you know what i need, want you to see everything
want you to see all of the lights
