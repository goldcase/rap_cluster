"lil jimmy skit"
hey jimmy where you going?
i dont know where i'm goin.
my dad died, and he left me his degrees.
my mom would always say "dad, why dont you work?",
but he just kept learning.
all the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school,
and i was actaully in school all when my dad was in school.
he was so gready with degrees, he took my degree.
and now i'm just glad he left me these.
because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what i have.
these are documented.
my father left them for me.
and im going to leave them to my kids.
i'm going to learn too.
i'm going to get super smart, so i to can die without money.
but i'll be the smartest dead guy.
who has that.
