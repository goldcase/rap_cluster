champion
realize
champion
eyes
yes packed brought back crib
little somethin show live
everybody want aint serious

eyes
dont see wild crowd is
dont see fly style is
dont see need stylist
shop much speak italian
dont know wanted better kids
aint sayin projects
everytime want layaway deposit
dadll say see clothes close eyelids
sort like smith son
movie aint talkin bout rich ones
cause every summer hell get some
brand new harebrained scheme get rich from
dont know dough
hed sent back school new wardrobe hey
feel like livings harder dyin

know invincible
realize

rounders mob pop guns
stand stand comes
tell takes number one
tell takes number one
story champion
rounders mob pop guns
stand stand comes
tell takes number one
tell takes number one
