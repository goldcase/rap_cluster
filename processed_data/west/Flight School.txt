flight school
feat tpain
let get theme music
baby forget everything know
lets take way back hello
say youre living like died before
got place go
oooh let take flight school
well learn fly
oooh let take flight school
lights
hey
youve never high kiss ground goodbye
say damn baby get fly
flight school
got superman power superman cape
last hours superman late
clock ticking damn wait
man come back save day
fly across earth put things reverse
wish life movie could rehearse
certain things cant doctor say im worst
aint enough patience needed nurse
thatll come bed late see head ache
get head straight give head great
every time popped like vcr
took breath away performed cpr
cars clothes lights boats
guess trying sow raw oats
penthouse position penthouse btches
see pimped crib must exhibit
sht last years haze like isaac
close eyes tighter asian eyes
get realize got wings angels fly with
louis vuitton feathers thats fly sht
baby
forget everything know
lets take way back hello
say youre living like died before
got place go
oooh let take flight school
well learn fly
oooh let take flight school
lights
hey
youve never high kiss ground goodbye
say damn baby get fly
flight school
