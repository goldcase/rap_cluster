"flight school"
(feat. t-pain)
let me get my theme music!
baby, just forget everything that you know
let's take it all the way back to hello
they say you're living like you died before
i got a place that only i can go
oooh let me take you to flight school
we'll learn to fly
oooh let me take you to flight school
above all the lights
hey
you've never been so high kiss the ground goodbye
and you say damn baby how did you get that fly
flight school
i got my superman power, my superman cape
these the last hours but superman late
clock is ticking, damn, can you wait
man will he come back and save the day
fly across the earth put things in reverse
i wish this life was a movie i could just rehearse
certain things i can't doctor and you say i'm the worst
i ain't have enough patience but i needed a nurse
that'll come by my bed late, see if my head ache
then get my head straight then give me head great
every time i popped up like the vcr
i took your breath away then we performed cpr
with all the cars the clothes, the lights, the boats
i guess i was just trying to sow my raw oats
in the penthouse position with penthouse b*tches
see i pimped my crib so i must exhibit
sh!t these last years been a haze like isaac
so i close my eyes tighter than asian eyes
get realize i got the same wings angels fly with
louis vuitton feathers now that's some fly sh*t
baby
just forget everything that you know
let's take it all the way back to hello
they say you're living like you died before
i got a place that only i can go
oooh let me take you to flight school
we'll learn to fly
oooh let me take you to flight school
above all the lights
hey
you've never been so high kiss the ground goodbye
and you say damn baby how did you get that fly
flight school
