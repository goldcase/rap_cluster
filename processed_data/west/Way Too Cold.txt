kanye west lyrics
way cold
originally theraflu
feat dj khaled
can’t young nigga get money anymore
tell peta mink dragging floor
bad bitch without flaws
come meet without drawers
dinner anna wintour racing anja rubik
told ma’fuckers music
projects one day project runway
done heard loudass talking we’re used it
i’m shorties fucked doublecupped up
might even kill somebody youtube it
whoever think words affect stupid

flyer parakeet floatin’ parachute
six thousand dollar pair shoes made paris news
don’t talk style cause embarrass you
shut fuck talk ‘fore embarrassed you
can’t young nigga get money anymore
tell peta mink dragging floor
bad bitch without flaws
come meet without drawers
whole industry want fuck old chick
nigga got respect wiz

around time fell love him
well that’s cool baby girl ya thang
lucky ain’t jay drop team
la familia roc nation

flyer parakeet floatin’ parachute
six thousand dollar pair shoes made paris news
don’t talk style cause embarrass you
shut fuck talk ‘fore embarrassed you
good music fresh fresh

bitchass niggas got ass breasts

can’t young nigga get money anymore
tell peta mink dragging floor
bad bitch without flaws
