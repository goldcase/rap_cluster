"love lockdown"
i'm not loving you, the way i wanted to
what i had to do, had to run from you
i'm in love with you but the vibe is wrong
and that haunted me, all the way home
so you never know, never never know,
never know enough, 'til it's over love
'til we lose control, system overload
screamin' "no! no! no! n-no!"
i'm not loving you, the way i wanted to
see i wanna move, but can't escape from you
so i keep it low, keep a secret code
so everybody else don't have to know
so keep your love locked down
your love locked down
keepin' your love locked down
your love locked down
now keep your love locked down
your love locked down
now keep your love locked down
you lose
i'm not lovin' you the way i wanted to
i can't keep my cool, so i keep it true
i got somethin to lose, so i gotta move
i can't keep myself, and still keep you too
so i keep in mind, when i'm on my own
somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
how many times did i tell ya fo it finally got through
you lose, you lose
i'm not lovin' you, the way i wanted to
see i had to go, see i had to move
no more wastin' time, you can't wait for life
we're just wastin' time, where's the finish line
so keep your love locked down
your love locked down
keepin' your love locked down
your love locked down
now keep your love locked down
your love locked down
now keep your love locked down
you lose
i'm not lovin you, the way i wanted to
i bet no one knew, i got no one new
i know i said i'm through, but got love for you
but i'm not lovin' you, the way i wanted to
gotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' goin'
keep it on a roll, only god knows
if i be with you, baby i'm confused
you choose, you choose
i'm not lovin' you, the way i wanted to
where i wanna go, i don't need you
i've been down this road, too many times before
i'm not lovin' you, the way i wanted to
so keep your love locked down
your love locked down
keepin' your love locked down
your love locked down
now keep your love locked down
your love locked down
now keep your love locked down
you lose, you lose
you lose, you lose
you lose
