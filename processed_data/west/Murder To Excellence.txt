murder excellence
jayz
bloody murder murder murder
paper read murder black black murder
paper read murder black black murder
memory danroy henry
much enemy fire catch friendly
strays shade nigga team
giving respect expect thing
black everything nigga know fresh code
i’m fightin’ don’t increase stress load
niggas watchin’ throne happy be
power people see see you
i’m murder capital murder capital
heard least 3 killings afternoon
lookin’ news like damn school
shop class half school got tool
could die day type attitude
plus little brother got shot reppin’ avenue
it’s time us stop redefine black power
41 souls murdered 50 hours
paper read murder black black murder
paper read murder black black murder again
murder again…
genocide
cause still hear momma cry know family traumatized
shots left holes face bout piranhasize
old pastor closed cold casket
said church ain’t got enough room tombs
it’s war going outside ain’t safe from
feel pain city wherever go
314 soldiers died iraq
509 died chicago
arrived day fred hampton died
real niggas multiply
say 21 supposed die
i’m celebratin’ post demise
put crabs barrel insure survival
gon’ end pulling niggas look like you
blood cos
it’s black love us
paper read murder black black murder
paper read murder black black murder again
black black murder again
black black murder again
it’s celebration black excellence
black tie black maybachs
black excellence opulence decadence
tuxes next president i’m present
dress dries boutique stores paris
sheepskin coats silence lamb
know clarice
cheap cologne whenever “shhshh”
success never smelled sweet stink success
new black elite say black card bear mark beast
repeat religion beat
verse like church jesus piece please domino domino
spot blacks higher go
what’s shoutout o
ain’t enough gon’ need million more
kick door biggie flow
i’m dressed nowhere go
yea it’s messed it’s nowhere go
won’t take time til reach o p
paroles hold g’s sold keys low keys
like promised land og’s
past picture events like black tie
what’s last thing expect see black guys
what’s life expectancy black guys
system’s working effectively that’s why
i’ll real man take care son
every problem day done
new crib watch movie
cause ain’t nothin’ news blues
hit mall pick gucci
ain’t nothin’ new shoes
sunday morning praise lord
girl jesus saving for
let’s savor moment take floor
black excellence truly yours
