blame game
feat john legend
lets play blame game love more
lets play blame game sure
lets call names names hate more
lets call names names sure
ill call bitch short last resort first result
call motherfucker long
end know wrong
love play blame game love more
lets play blame game sure
lets call names names hate more
lets call names names sure
bathroom wall wrote
id rather argue someone else else else else
took piss dismiss like fuck went found somebody else
fuck arguing harvesting feelings id rather fucking self
till 2am call back hang start blame myself
somebody help
werent perfect made life worth it
stick around real feelings might surface
long time since spoke bathroom gripping fuckin choking you
hell supposed do
know aint getting type dick local dude
hope good time
cause definitely mine
aint finna see mogul get emotional
every time hear bout niggas stroking you
might say hit you
sitting consoling you
runnin name mud
whos provoking you
grateful nigga like ever noticed you
noticeable cant nobody control you
1 cant nobody get hold you
im calling brothers phone like supposed do
even though knew never told truth
gon say whatever gon told too
certain point stop asking questions
chuck dirt eachother like mud wrestlers
heard bought coke money
dat aint right girl
getting blackmailed white girl
always said yeezy aint youre right girl
probably find one like art type girls
lights caught hype girl
satisfied love lie
blame blame blame
pain poured every time rained
lets play blame game
lets play blame game love more
lets play blame game sure
things used not
anything us are
disguising secret lovers
weve become public enemies
walk away like strangers street
gone eternity
erased one another
far came
much everything leave nothing
lack visual empathy equates meaning love
hatred attitude tear us entirely
lets play blame game love more
lets play blame game sure
lets call names names hate more
lets call names names sure
cant love much
cant love much
cant love much
cant love much
cant love much
cant love much
