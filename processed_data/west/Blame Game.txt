"blame game"
(feat. john legend)
let's play the blame game, i love you, more
let's play the blame game for sure.
let's call her names, names, i hate you, more.
let's call her names, names, for sure.
i'll call you bitch for short as a last resort and my first result.
you call me motherfucker for long,
at the end of it you know we both were wrong.
but i love to play the blame game, i love you more.
let's play the blame game for sure.
let's call out names, names, i hate you, more.
let's call out names, names, for sure.
on a bathroom wall i wrote
"i'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else" (else, else, else)
i took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and i went and found somebody else
fuck arguing or harvesting the feelings, i'd rather be by my fucking self
till about 2am and i call back and i hang up and start to blame myself
somebody help
you weren't perfect but you made life worth it
stick around, real feelings might surface
been a long time since i spoke to you in a bathroom gripping you up fuckin and choking you
what the hell was i supposed to do
i know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude
and if you are i hope you are have a good time
cause i definitely be having mine
and you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
every time i hear bout other nigga's stroking you
might say i hit you
he sitting there consoling you
runnin my name through the mud
who's provoking you
you should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
now you noticeable and cant nobody can control you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
i'm calling your brothers phone like what was i supposed to do
even though i knew, he never told the truth
he was just gon say whatever you gon told him too
at a certain point i had to stop asking questions
chuck dirt on eachother like mud wrestlers
i heard he bought some coke with my money
dat aint right girl
you getting blackmailed for that white girl
you always said yeezy i ain't you're right girl
probably find one of them "i like art" type girls
all of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
and i was satisfied being in love with the lie
and who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
for the pain and it poured every time when it rained
let's play the blame game...
let's play the blame game, i love you, more
let's play the blame game for sure.
things used to be, now they not
anything but us is who we are
disguising ourselves as secret lovers
we've become public enemies
we walk away like strangers in the street
gone for eternity
we erased one another
so far from where we came
with so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing
lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of l-o-v-e
hatred and attitude tear us entirely
let's play the blame game, i love you, more
let's play the blame game for sure.
let's call out names, names, i hate you, more.
let's call out names, names, for sure.
i can't love you this much
i can't love you this much
i can't love you this much
i can't love you this much
no, i can't love you this much
i can't love you this much
and i know that you are somehwere doing your thing
and when the phone called it just ring and ring
you aint pick up but your phone accidently called me back
and i heard the whole thing.
i heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing...
ohh my god..
baby you done took this shit to another motherfucking level
now a neighbourhood nigga like me aint supposed to be gettin no pussy like this
