roses lyrics
kanye west lyrics
roses
know past visiting hours
please give flowers
doctor dont wanna take procedures
claim heart cant take anastesia
itll send body seizure
little thing hospital bed itll stop beeping
hey chick im lost words
say time
remember nine
tell everything gone fine
id lying family crying
want live trying
im argueing like kind doctor fly in
know best medicine go people thats paid
magic johnson got cure aids
broke muthafuckers past away
tellin grandma nba
right shed ok
since secretary
working church
thirty five years
things sposed stop right here
grandfather tryin pull together hes strong
thats get confidence from
asked nurse research
ask sign tshirts
bitch smokin reefer
dont see hurt
still
smile
roses come see me
cant wait sunny day
im seeing eyes
cant wait clouds break
outside emergency room room
feel heart beat beat beat
gone pull through
gone find soon
right sleep sleep sleep
mama say say could pass away day
hey chick doctors know anyway
let see xrays
aint expert im hurt
cousin kim took work
plus aunt shirley aunt beverly aunt claire aunt jean
many aunties could auntie team
feel like amerie one thing
said made it
see eyes gleam
think time high
get run fly drive
coz family know home is
instead sending flowers
roses
smile
roses come see me
cant wait sunny day
im seeing eyes
cant wait clouds break
brings sunshine
ohhhhh smile
roses come see me
cant wait sunny day
im seeing eyes
cant wait clouds break
