"roses"
i know it's past visiting hours
but can i please give her these flowers
the doctor dont wanna take procedures
he claim my heart can't take the anastesia
it'll send her body into a seizure
the little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beeping,
hey chick, im at a lost for words
what do you say at this time?
remember when i was nine?
tell her everything gone be fine?
but i'd be lying, the family crying
they want her to live, and she trying
i'm argueing like what kind of doctor can we fly in
you know the best medicine go to people thats paid,
if magic johnson got a cure for a.i.d.s.
and all the broke muthafuckers past away
you tellin me if my grandma was in the n.b.a.
right now she'd be ok?
but since she was just a secretary
working for the church
for thirty five years
things sposed to stop right here
my grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong,
thats where i get my confidence from
i asked the nurse "did you do the research?"
she ask me, "can you sign some t-shirts?"
bitch is you smokin reefer?
you dont see that we hurt
but still...
...i smile
when roses come to see me
and i can't wait for a sunny day
(im seeing it through your eyes)
can't wait for the clouds to break
they outside of the emergency room, room
you can feel my heart beat, beat, beat
if she gone pull through
we gone find out soon
but right now she sleep, sleep, sleep
my mama say, they say she could pass away any day
hey chick what these doctors know anyway
let me see the x-rays
i ain't no expert, i'm just hurt
cousin kim took off for work
plus my aunt shirley, aunt beverly, aunt claire and aunt jean
so many aunties, we could have an auntie team
feel like amerie "its this one thing"
when they said that she made it
you see the eyes gleam
i think we at an all time high
to get there we run, we fly, we drive
coz with my family we know where home is
so instead of sending flowers
we the roses...
i smile
when roses come to see me
and i can't wait for a sunny day
(im seeing it through your eyes)
can't wait for the clouds to break
who brings the sunshine?
ohhhhh i smile
when roses come to see me
and i can't wait for a sunny day
(im seeing it through your eyes)
can't wait for the clouds to break
