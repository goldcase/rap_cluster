bound 2
feat charlie wilson
bound fall love
bound fall love uhhuh honey
niggas lame know now
real nigga hold supposed drown
bound
bound fall love
bound fall love uhhuh honey
club thursday
say girl birthday
ordered champagne still look thirsty
rock forever 21 turned thirty
know got bad reputation
walking round always mad reputation
leave pretty girl sad reputation
start fight club brad reputation
turned nightclub basement
ill turn plane round ass keep complaining

dutty wining round jamaicans

nobody love nobody nobody uhhuh honey
close eyes let word paint thousand pictures
one good girl worth thousand bitches
