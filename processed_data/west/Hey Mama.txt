famous homemade chicken soup another bowl
work late nights keep lights
mommy got training wheels could keep bike

michael jackson leather glove didnt give curl

knelt kitchen floor

see youre unbreakable unmistakable
highly capable lady thats makin loot

forrest gump mama said life like box chocolates
mama told go school get doctorate
somethin fall back could profit with
still supported opposite
feel like things gotta get
things gotta prove you

maya angelou nicky giovanni turn one page theres mommy
come mommy dance wit let whole world see dancing feet
say hey yall say mama everybody answer hey mama

tint windows ride around city let ya friends know hey mama
