"hey mama"
(hey mama), i wanna scream so loud for you, cuz i'm so proud of you
let me tell you what i'm about to do, (hey mama)
i know i act a fool but, i promise you i'm goin back to school
i appreciate what you allowed for me
i just want you to be proud of me (hey mama)
i wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
this little light of mine and i'm finna let it shine
i'm finna take yall back to them better times
i'm finna talk about my mama if yall don't mind
i was three years old, when you and i moved to the chi
late december, harsh winter gave me a cold
you fixed me up something that was good for my soul
famous homemade chicken soup, can i have another bowl?
you work late nights just to keep on the lights
mommy got me training wheels so i could keep on my bike
and you would give anything in this world
michael jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
and you never put no man over me
and i love you for that mommy cant you see?
seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then i started to cry
as we knelt on the kitchen floor
i said mommy imma love you till you don't hurt no more
and when i'm older, you aint gotta work no more
and imma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
see you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
highly capable, lady that's makin loot
a livin legend too, just look at what heaven do
send us an angel, and i thank you (hey mama)
forrest gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
my mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
but still supported me when i did the opposite
now i feel like it's things i gotta get
things i gotta do, just to prove to you
you was getting through, can the choir please
give me a verse of "you, are so beautiful to me"
can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
maya angelou, nicky giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
now when i say hey, yall say mama, now everybody answer me (hey mama)
i guess it also depends tho, if my ends low
second they get up you gon get that benzo
tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (hey mama)
tell your job you gotta fake em out
since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
to a restaurant, upper echelon
imma get you a jag, whatever else you want
just tell me what kind of s-type donda west like?
tell me the perfect color so i make it just right
it don't gotta be mother's day, or your birthday
for me to just call and say (hey mama)
