while you all was in limbo i raised the bar up
i touched on everything
married to the game rock a chain stead of a wedding ring
you all brides maids catch the garter
on nights when romance
cameras flash so much

after each and every show a couple dykes in the van

house on the hill
two doors from tracey ross
and i'm asking about her girlfriends yeah the dark skinned ones
