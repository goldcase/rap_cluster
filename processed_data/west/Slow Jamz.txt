"slow jamz"
(feat. twista, jamie foxx)
are you gonna be?
say that you're gonna be
oh oh oh oh oh...
she said she wants some marvin gaye, some luther vandross, a little anita, will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be? well well well well well)
she said she want some ready for the world, some new edition, some minnie ripperton, and definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be? well well well well well)
i told her to drive over in your new whip
bring some friends you cool with
i'm gonna bring the cool whip
then i want you to strip
see you is my new chick
so we get our grind on
she be grabbing, calling me biggie like shine home
man, i swear she fine homes
why she always lying though
telling me them diamonds when she know they rhinestones
she got a light skinned friend look like michael jackson
got a dark skinned friend look like michael jackson
i play 'ready for the world' - she was ready for some action
my dawg said you ain't no freak, so you got to prove my man wrong
i'm a play this vandross
you're gonna take your pants off
i'm gonna play this gladys knight
me and you're gonna get right
got you looking at the gliss at my hands and wrists
while i'm laying back smoking on my cannabis
when it come to rocking the rhythm like marvin and luther
i can tell you ain't no messing with kan-man and twist
from the chi and i be
sipping hennessy
play some r&b
trying to smoke a b
looking properly
feeling on a g?
and always (well well well well well)
come with me and sip on some evelyn champagne
you ain't know twista can work it like the whispers
hit the stop light, get into some isaac
the rims still moving so i'm bumping little spinners
while i'm smoking on a b
dipping through the streets
bumping r&b
and i got to leave
something to the 23's?
and i do it (well well well well well)
with my earth and the wind smoke a fire
let me when get your sheets wet listening to keith sweat
put you in a daze for maze
fullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex
you ready for the world girl
come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
an every moment you controllin' me i'm loving the way you be holding me when i be listening to jodeci
and when i come over and bend your ass
you be bumping teddy pendergrass
i'd hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
now i gotta go up in it fast, but i'm gonna finish last
no matter how much of a thug you see
i still spit it like it's r&b, so to the club with me
and with some luther come on and hope you finna and still be in love with me
baby drop another slow jam
and all us lovers need hold hands
and if you ain't got no man hop up in my brougham
i keep it pimping like an old man
you got to roll with the plan
cause after that then i
take it to the dome
then i got to bone
stay up in the zone
got to get you home
gotta run up on
and i do it (well well well well well)
baby drop another slow jam
and all us lovers need hold hands
and if you ain't got no man hop up on my brohem
i keep it pimping like an old man
you got to roll with the plan
cause after that then i
take you to my home
and we could get it on
disconnect the phone
just to get you goin'
trying to make you moan
and i do it (well well well well well)
