"the new workout plan"
you just popped in the kanye west
get right for the summer workout tape
and ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
you might bear to pull you a rapper, a nba player
man, at least a dude wit' a car
so first of all we gon' work on the stomach
nobody wants a little tight ass!
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
it's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
what's scary to me is henny makes girls look like halle berry to me
so excuse me miss, i forgot your name
thank you, god bless you, good night i came..
i came...
i came..
it's been a week without me
and she feels weak without me
she wanna talk it out but
ain't nothin to talk about less
she talks about freakin out so
maybe we can work it out
work it out
maybe we could work it out
oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
my name kanye from the jigga set twista said get it wet
ooh, girl your breath is harsh
cover your mouth up like you got sars
off them tracks yea i bought them cars
still killa a nigga on 16 bars
we ain't sweatin' to the oldies we jukin to a cold beat
maybe one day girl we can bone
so you can brag to all your homies now
but i still mess with a big girl if you ain't fit girl i'll hit girl
1 and you brought 2 friends ok 3 more now hop in the benz
4 door do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8
all the mocha lattes you gotta do pilates
you gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
hustlers, gangstas, all us, ballas
hi, may name is jill, i just want to say thanks to
kanye's workout plan. i was able to pull a nba player
and like now i shop every day on rodeo drive
