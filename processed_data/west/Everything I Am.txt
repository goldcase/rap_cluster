"everything i am" lyrics
kanye west lyrics
"everything i am"
oh oh oho.
damn, here we go again.
oh oh oho.
common passed on this beat, i made it to a jam,
now everything i'm not, made me everything i am.
damn, here we go again.
people talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything i'm not, made me everything i am.
i never be picture-perfect-beyonce
be light as al b or black as chauncey
remember him from blackstreet
he was as black as the street was
i'll never be laid back as his beat was
i never could see why people'll reach a
fake-ass facade they couldn't keep up
you see how i creeped up?
you see how i played a big role in chicago like queen latifah?
i never rock a mink coat in the winter time like killa cam
or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
let me know if you feel it man
'cause everything i'm not, made me everything i am
damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
everything i'm not, made me everything i am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything i'm not, made me everything i am
and i'm back to tear it up
haters, start your engines
i hear 'em gearin' up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops
they forget to get their haircut
ok fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'cause they want gun-talk, or i don't wear enough
baggy clothes, reebok's, or adidas
can i add that he do spaz out at his shows
so say goodbye to the naacp award
goodbye to the india.arie award
they'd rather give me the nigga-please award
but i'll just take the i-got-a-lot-of-cheese award
damn, here we go again.
everything i'm not, made me everything i am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything i'm not, made me everything i am
i know that people wouldn't usually rap this
but i got the facts to back this
just last year, chicago had over 600 caskets
man, killing's some wack shit
oh, i forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
he got changed over his chains, a block off ashland
i need to talk to somebody, pastor
the church want tithe, so i can't afford to pay
the slip on the door, cause i can't afford to stay
my 15 seconds up, but i got more to say
that's enough mr. west, please no more today
damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
everything i'm not, made me everything i am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything i'm not, made me everything i am
