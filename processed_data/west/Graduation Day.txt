"graduation day"
what in the fuck was that kanye
i told you to do some shit for the kids
you can give me your muthafucking graduation ticket right now
you will not walk across that stage, you won’t slide across that stage
a muthafucka can’t pull you across that stage kanye
who told you see, i told you to do something up lifting
i’m trynna get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me
you know what us a nigga
and i don’t mean that in no nice way
had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you
you throw your mutha hands in the air, and wave good-bye to everybody
cause you getting the fuck out of this campus
mutha what you gone do now
i'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody.
i'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody.
i got something better than school but don't tell anybody.
my momma would kill me but don't anybody.
she wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody.
she ain'twalked in my shoes i'm just not everybody.
