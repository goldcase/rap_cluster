touch sky lyrics
kanye west lyrics
touch sky
feat lupe fiasco
gotta testify come spot looking extra fly
day die imma touch sky
gotta testify come spot looking extra fly
day die imma touch sky
back thought pink polos would hurt roc
cam got shit pop doors closed
felt like bad boys street team couldnt work lox locks
lets go
take em back plan
momma hopped uhaul van
pessimists aint talked them
plus aint phone apartment
lets take em back club
least hour would stand line
wanted dance
went jacob hour got advance
wanted shine
jays favorite line dog due time
look like damn dog am
hip hop legend
think died accident cause must heaven
lets take em highighighighighigh la la la la la la la
top world baby ttop world
lets take em highighighighighigh la la la la la la la
top world baby ttop world
back gucci shit rock
back slick rick got shit pop
id anything say got it
damn new loafers hurt pocket
anybody wanted kwest beats
girl split buffet kfc
dog nervous breakdowns
like damn niggas much better me
baby im going airplane
dont know ill back again
sure enough sent plane tickets
came kick things became different
girl cheated sheets skeeted on
couldnt keep home thought needed nia long
im trying write wrongs
funny wrongs helped write song
now
gotta testify come spot looking extra fly
day die gonna touch sky
gonna touch sky babygirl testify come spot
looking extra fly
day die gonna touch sky

peach fuzz buzz beard verge

fresh pair steps best foreign car

yeah keep rolling
feels good home baby feels good home
