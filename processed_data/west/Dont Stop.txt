dont stop lyrics
kanye west lyrics
dont stop
performed child rebel soldier
lupe fiasco  pharrell
explain sound like me
muthafucking skateboard p
knowing mee lo
playing games like you’re ceelo
tight situation like speedo’s
way like carlito
nigga happy give torpedos
car twisted like blunt
faggot ass niggas like front
i’m bbc bape shit
im cake shit
kitchen heat making beats apron
hating want erase it
close eyes know can’t take it
flow interrupts homeostasis
rolls royce regular basis
talk street shit sound like sweet shit
straight liquorice niggas sound ticklish
80k large hermes dream
coke n crop magazines
hunger strike look like celine
dion niggas like freon
bitches pecan
got ass eat on
try play tough like leather vuiton
hit til could seat on
try get freak on
ask r kelly ya get pee’d on
said aint maam
8 behind still got burner
yes enzo stilll black like sojourner
truth mighta loosened tooth
spittin’ booth
i’m pooof
carrera raised teenage mutant ninja turtle era
wanna bear n tell truth dare ya
ya lie eat whole bottle jalapeno peppers
terror made america live
fuck property give props properly
high life high technology devry
rep muhammad ali like rapology
policy’s dishonestly deprived
gimme gimme keep going
city i’m like steak fries never die
wanna ghostface wanna me
post haste follow life
means going right i’ve
i’m hero sort like jack sparrow
someway somehow survived
ha ha surprised
see coming tides
speed boat boat load pride
fall rome dress shirted mastermind tie
happens rappping happen fashion collide
omg c crs lol’ing haters
tell bff’s like
yes mr west turn new child rebel
loud badass child level
need chorus tyrannosaurus
tyrone it’s year phone
could explain high zone
we’ll take plane rub nose cocaine
there’s hoes magazines lame sayin lame
hate advance pull pants
make ‘em kiss cheeks like living france
diamonds blue business manager’s jewish
get sued lawyers jews
girls grab cojones
say got enough diamonds least sierra loanus
brand new ferrari’s gotta make donuts
crs like hip hop christmas bonus
niggas hating internet couldn’t tell
busy rapping good hell
busy flying parasail
tell collect get new shit paris sell
tarantino da vinci gettin’ benji’s get half fendi
half that’s cindy’s
hoped spaceship mork mindy
popped many corks let dork’s offend me
props new york chi town’s city
get city hoochie’s gucci monica bellucci’s
real millionnaires bendi’s
i’m ultra i’m even oprah
let check account haha sir
don’t stop dont stop
