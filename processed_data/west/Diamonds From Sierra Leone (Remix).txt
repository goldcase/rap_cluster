diamonds sierra leone remix
feat jayz
diamonds forever
theyre need please me

fear might
desert me
diamonds forever forever forever

ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
good morning aint vietnam still
people lose hands legs arms real
little known sierra leone
connect diamonds own
speak diamonds song
aint talkin bout ones glowin
im talkin bout rocafella home chain
aint conflict diamonds jacob dont lie mayne
see part sayin keep shinin

diamonds chains bracelets charmses
thought jesus piece harmless
til seen picture shorty armless

black persons soul rock gold
spend ya whole life tryna get ice
polo rugby look nice

let handle buisness damn
kanyeez got freeway foxy
yg teairra mari petey watch me
bleek could one hit away whole career
long im alive hes millionaire
even die hes somewhere
kick back chill somewhere oh yeah

dynasty like money last three lifetimes
shirley bassey rear sayin exactly
sayin practically whole career
diamond forever minin forever
louis vuitton dons timin couldnt better
people lined see titanic sinkin
instead rose ashes like phoenix
waitin end dynasty sign
itll seem like forever mighty long time
im young bitches
goodnight
