"wake up mr. west"
(feat. bernie mac)
i knew i was gonna see ya, i knew i was gonna see you again!
i was gonna see you again
where your god damn book bag at?
always carryin' that lil book bag
nobody wanna see that
god damn fourth grader
sit yo' ass down
?? wanna play it again like he got somethin else to do
you ain't got nothin' else to do
you ain't doin nothin wit yo life
nothing with your life
what do you think this is?
you betta look at me when i'm talkin' to you!
you think this is easy don't you?
you think this is promised
oh ain't nothin promised with you
look at my face, do i got a promise face?
does it look like promise you anything?
kanye!
ni**a! is you snorin' in my class?
wake up mr. west! mr. west
