wake mr west
feat bernie mac
knew gonna see ya knew gonna see again
gonna see again
god damn book bag at
always carryin lil book bag
nobody wanna see that
god damn fourth grader
sit yo ass down
wanna play like got somethin else do
aint got nothin else do
aint doin nothin wit yo life
nothing life
think is

think easy dont you
think promised
oh aint nothin promised you
look face got promise face
look like promise anything
