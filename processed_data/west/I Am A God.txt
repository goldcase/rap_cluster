kanye west lyrics
"i am a god"
blazing, mi don't want them
mi need them
blazing
suh mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
and now she find out what life is really worth
no to x rated
yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt
and now she find out what life is really worth
no to x rated
i am a god
i am a god
i am a god
i am a god
hurry up with my damn massage
hurry up with my damn m√©nage
get the porsche out the damn garage
i am a god
even though i'm a man of god
my whole life in the hands of god
so y'all better quit playing with god
soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
cause kissing people ass is so unlike you
the only rapper compared to michael
so here's a few hating-ass niggas who'll fight you
and here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
and i don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
old niggas mentally still in high school
since the tight jeans they never liked you
pink-ass polos with a fucking backpack
but everybody know you brought real rap back
nobody had swag, man, we the rat pack
virgil pyrex, don c snapback
ivan, diamond, chi-town shining
monop' in this bitch, get a change of climate
hop in this bitch and get the same thing i'm in
until the day i get struck by lightning
i am a god
so hurry up with my damn massage
in a french-ass restaurant
hurry up with my damn croissants
i am a god
i am a god
i am a god
aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!
aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!
aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!
i just talked to jesus
he said, "what up yeezus?"
i said, "shit i'm chilling
trying to stack these millions."
i know he the most high
but i am a close high
mi casa, su casa
that's that cosa nostra
i am a god
i am a god
i am a god
aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!
aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!
aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!
aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!
ain't no way i'm giving up. i'm a god
