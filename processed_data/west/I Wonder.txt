ive waiting whole life
dreams waking night

means find dreams
say get fucking nerves
hope get deserves word
even remember issue is
trying find tissue is
still wish is

thats intuition is
hop back car
drive back crib
run back arms
smokescreens
chokes screams
ever wonder really mean
wonder know

wonder know
means find dreams
im back grind
psychic read lifeline
told lifetime
name would help light chicago skyline
thats im
seven oclock thats primetime
heavenll watch god calling hot lines
keep giving hot lines
im star could shine
many ladies house
many ladies house without spouse
something blouse got feeling aroused
about
independent shit
trade husband kids
ever wonder really mean
ever wonder youll find dreams
