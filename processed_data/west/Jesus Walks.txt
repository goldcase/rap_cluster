"jesus walks" lyrics
kanye west lyrics
"jesus walks"
yo, we at war
we at war with terrorism, racism, and most of all we at war with ourselves
(jesus walks)
god show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(jesus walks with me) with me, with me, with me
you know what the midwest is?
young & restless
where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace
and next these (niggas) might jack your lexus
somebody tell these (niggas) who kanye west is
i walk through the valley of the shadow of death is
top floor the view alone will leave you breathless uhhhh!
try to catch it uhhhh! it's kinda hard
getting choked by the detectives yeah yeah now check the method
they be asking us questions, harass and arrest us
saying, "we eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast."
huh? y'all eat pieces of shit? what's the basis?
we ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
a trunk full of coke rental car from avis
my mamma used to say only jesus can save us
well mamma i know i act a fool
but i'll be gone 'til november i got packs to move i hope
(jesus walks)
god show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(jesus walks with me)
the only thing that that i pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(jesus walks)
and i don't think there is nothing i can do now to right my wrongs
(jesus walks with me)
i want to talk to god but i'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
to the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
(jesus walks with them)
to the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
(jesus walks with them)
now hear ye hear ye want to see thee more clearly
i know he hear me when my feet get weary
cause we're the almost nearly extinct
we rappers are role models we rap we don't think
i ain't here to argue about his facial features
or here to convert atheists into believers
i'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
the way kathie lee needed regis that's the way i need jesus
so here go my single dog radio needs this
they say you can rap about anything except for jesus
that means guns, sex, lies, video tapes
but if i talk about god my record won't get played huh?
well if this take away from my spins
which will probably take away from my ends
then i hope this take away from my sins
and bring the day that i'm dreaming about
next time i'm in the club everybody screaming out
(jesus walks)
god show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(jesus walks)
the only thing that that i pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(jesus walks)
and i don't thing there's nothing i can do now to right my wrongs
(jesus walks with me... fades)
i want to talk to god but i'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
