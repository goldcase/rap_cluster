jesus walks lyrics
kanye west lyrics
jesus walks
yo war
war terrorism racism war ourselves
jesus walks
god show way devil trying break down
jesus walks
know midwest is
young  restless
restless niggas might snatch necklace
next niggas might jack lexus
somebody tell niggas kanye west is
walk valley shadow death is
top floor view alone leave breathless uhhhh
try catch uhhhh kinda hard
getting choked detectives yeah yeah check method
asking us questions harass arrest us
saying eat pieces shit like breakfast
huh yall eat pieces shit whats basis
aint going nowhere got suits cases
trunk full coke rental car avis
mamma used say jesus save us
well mamma know act fool
ill gone til november got packs move hope
jesus walks
god show way devil trying break down
jesus walks me
thing pray feet dont fail now
jesus walks
dont think nothing right wrongs
jesus walks me
want talk god im afraid aint spoke long
hustlers killers murderers drug dealers even strippers
jesus walks them
victims welfare living hell hell yeah
jesus walks them
hear ye hear ye want see thee clearly
know hear feet get weary
cause almost nearly extinct
rappers role models rap dont think
aint argue facial features
convert atheists believers
im trying say way school need teachers
way kathie lee needed regis thats way need jesus

means guns sex lies video tapes
talk god record wont get played huh
well take away spins
probably take away ends
hope take away sins
bring day im dreaming about
next time im club everybody screaming out
jesus walks
god show way devil trying break down
jesus walks
thing pray feet dont fail now
jesus walks
dont thing theres nothing right wrongs
jesus walks fades
want talk god im afraid aint spoke long
