"hell of a life"
i think i just fell in love with a porn star
turn the camera on, she a born star
turn the corners in a foreign car
call the coroners do the cpr
she gave that old nigga a ulcer
her bitter sweet taste made his gold teeth fake, uh
make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what!
we headin' to hell for heaven's sake, huh!
well i'mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah!
have you lost your mind?
tell me when you think we crossed the line
no more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all i need
grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life
never in your wildest dreams, never in your wildest dreams
in your wildest
you could hear the loudest screams, comin' from inside the screen
you a wild bitch
tell me what i gotta do to be that guy
said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
or do anal, or do a gangbang
it's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
well i guess alotta niggas do gang bang
and if we run trains, we all in the same gang
runaway slaves all on a chain gang
bang bang bang bang bang
have you lost your mind?
tell me when you think we crossed the line
no more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all i need
grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life
one day i'm gon' marry a porn star
we'll have a big ass crib and a long yard
we'll have a mansion and some fly maids
nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bride's maid
she wanna role play, 'til i roll over
i'mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
what party is we goin' to on oscar day
'specially if she can't get that dress from oscar de
la renta, they wouldn't rent her they couldn't take the shame
snatched the dress off her back and told her, "get away."
how could you say they live they life wrong?
when you never fuck with the lights on
have you lost your mind?
tell me when you think we crossed the line
no more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all i need
grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life
i think i fell in love with a porn star
and got married in a bathroom
honeymoon on the dance floor
and got divorced by the end of the night
that's one hell of a life
