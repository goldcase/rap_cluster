get em high like noon moon room filled smoke
high filled dope
assumed doomed tune still feel notes

thats abuse thugs
rock clubs like tiger woods hood reality show

could ever let words affect say hiphop dead
im resurrect mosh sexy even make songs like these
thats raw dont know name like alicia keys

year clear image snooped up
label got souped telling youre sick
man dick loose nut
video hard watch like medusa
even club record need booster
chimped pimp cup illiterate nigga
read infa red across head imma bred king like simba
boulder denver aint madd rapper mc temper
