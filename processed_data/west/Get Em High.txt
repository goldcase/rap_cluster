"get em high"
(feat. talib kweli, common)
i'm trying to catch the beat, uh
i'm trying to catch the beat
i'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh
i'm trying to catch the beat
now, throw your motherfucking hands
get 'em high
all the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man
get 'em high
now i ain't never tell you to put down your hands
keep 'em high
and if your losing your high then* smoke again
keep 'em high
now, my flow
is in the pocket like wallets, i got the bounce like hydraulics
i can't call it, i got the swerve like alcoholics
my freshman year i was going through hella problems
'til i built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college
my teacher said i'm a loser, i told her why don't you kill me
i give a fuck if you fail me, i'm gonna follow my heart,
and if you follow the charts, or the plaques or the stacks
you ain't gotta guess who's back,
you see i'm so chi that you thought it was bashful
but this bastard's flow will bash a skull
and i will cut your girl like pastor troy
and i don't usually smoke but pass the 'dro
and i won't give you that money that you asking for
why you think me and dame cool? we're assholes!
that's why we hear your music in fast forward
'cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
now who the hell is this?
e-mailing me at 11:26, telling me that she 36-26, plus double d
you know how girls on black planet be when they get bubbly
at nyu but she hail from kansas, right now she just lampin, chilling on campus
sent me a picture with her feeling on candice
who said her favorite rapper was the late great francis
w-h-i-t, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet
so you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
his name kweli
(you mean talib, lyrics stick to your rib)
i mean
(that's my favorite cd that i play in my crib)
i mean
(you don't really know him, why is you lying)
you kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
she's gonna think that i'm lying, just spit a couple of lines
then maybe i'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high
yeah, i can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes
but never mind, i need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out
and my rhymes is finna blow you trying to blow backs out
well ok, you twisted my arm, i'll assist with the charm, aiyyo
ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your mom?
she's the bomb, but she got the boujee behavior
always got something to say like an ok player hater
anyway, i don't usually fuck with the internet
or chicks on birth control stuck to they arm like nicorette
you really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes
and she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
i apologize if i come off a little inconsiderate
i got the bubble kush and a sister could get a hit of it
get 'em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke
a high filled with dope
you all assumed i was doomed, out of tune, but i still feel the notes
the real nigga quotes
real rappers is hard to find like a remote control,
rap is not a used to but still got love,
that's why i abuse you who are not thugs
rock clubs, it's like tiger woods in the hood, to have my own reality show
called soul survivor, i stole all liver, niggas in you
you's a bitch i got ones that are thicker than you
how could i ever let your words affect me, they say hip-hop is dead
i'm here to resurrect me, mosh is too sexy to even make songs like these
that's why the raw don't know your name, like alicia keys
too many featured mcs, and producers is popular
twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her
album, how come, you the hot garbage of
the year, it's clear your image is snooped up
label got you souped up, telling you you're sick
man you a dick with a loose nut
video hard to watch like medusa
even your club record need a booster
chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
read the infa, red across your head imma bred king like simba
boulder then denver, i ain't a madd rapper just a mc with a temper
you dancing for money like honey, i did this my way
so when the industry crash, i survive like kanye
spitting through wires and fires, mcs retiring
got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then
