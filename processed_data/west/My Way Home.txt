way home lyrics
kanye west lyrics
way home
feat common
yeah
im way home
say home hate is
dome fate is
stroll souls get lost like vegas
seen eyes rebel glasses
pray god arms reach masses
young smoke grass grassless jungles
rubberband together cashless bundles
wear struggling chains
divided hustle remains
making sense hustle change
revolution aint game
another name
life fighting
someone stay corner like mike tyson
hypes fighting hits heighten hell
dont know get high fell
show money becomes bail
relationships become jail
children unheld
wish love sale
behold pale
horse got trapped like r kel bail it
might bad idea never never went home again
im way home
left three days ago
one seems know im gone
home hatred is
home filled pain it
might bad idea never
never went home again
