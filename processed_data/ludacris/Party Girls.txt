"party girls"
(feat. jeremih, wiz khalifa & cashmere cat)
i came to party like tonight will never end
let's party again; let's party again
yeah, i came to party like tonight will never end
let's party again; let's party again
let's party again
i need party girls, in my party world
titties plastic, ass fantastic
they just brush my hair, and touch me everywhere
i don't say shit, and they be gettin naked
naked, say shit, and they be gettin naked
i don't say shit, and they be gettin naked
luda~!
it's yo' world and i'ma touch wherever you want me to touch ya
pop that pop that and you'll be bustin a nut when you wanna bust-a
don't - rush 'em, i'ma take my time and do it slow
from the car to the counter to the bed to the couch to the drugs hit the flo'
oh! no! could be that a g really got you sprung?
i lost my count baby how many times did i make you cum?
run run run from a nigga 'til you can't no mo' like forrest gump
and it's mo' she gets - if it's mo' she wants
she spoiled rotten like bad milk, get her hot cause i make that ass melt
she whipped cause she love gettin whipped in the whip (wa-pow!) and i'm a black belt
i beat the pussy to pieces; never lettin the cat off the leashes
and i go so deep they tellin me all of they deepest and darkest secrets
yuh!!
throw some 1's on that (ass) and get you wet as a water pump
i'ma have some fun with that (ass) make her come back to "black and gold"
bust like a gun with that (ass) like pow pow, brrrr-pow-pow
brrr-my bitch be gettin down - nigga how 'bout yours?
so turned up when we in the club we don't even need a molly
do it so much over in this corner thought we was fuckin in a party
my lungs filled with marley, my hands on your body
and i'm goin so deep i'm just lettin you know
that this me i got your face all in the pillow
you can't speak
