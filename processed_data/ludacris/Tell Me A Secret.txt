"tell me a secret"
(feat. ne-yo)
i got 5 kisses where you want 'em at
either one on your lips,
your ear, your neck, your stomach, or your back.
your inner thigh, right on your knee cap or your belly button.
these other guys be out here talkin but they steady frontin,
they don't know what they want that's why i tell you put your trust in me.
share all your secrets, all your desires and your fantasies.
i aint gon tell nobody, baby i'm an only child.
i'd keep it to myself cuz all i wanna do is see you smile,
knowin that you got someone to talk to aint that what yu want?
i'll be your lover, your provider, and your confidont.
and i won't judge you cuz i kno that aint nobody perfect,
but you got some perfect imperfections that makes you worth it.
i wanna see yo body in all the positions that you like it in,
we could do it slow or have some drinks, it gets in enticing when...
you like it rough i give it rough and i start to pull your hair,
cuz ecstasy's your destination and ima take you there...
tell me a secret baby
tell me somethin that nobody else knows,
and think about it just as soon as the door closes.
tell me a secret baby,
tell tell tell me a secret baby.
show me somethin that nobody else sees.
tell me all the things you would do if it was you and me,
tell me a secret baby.
tell tell tell me a secret baby
and there aint nobody in the universe that compete's with you,
imagine all the possibilities and the freaky things that we could do.
blind folded,
hancuffed to the head board never let you go until you scream my name,
maybe you think im playin but this is really far from a mothafuckin game.
aint a damn thang changed still nasty as i wanna be.
and i got just what you want baby girl you want it..
see it'll turn you on and it's gonna be on as soon as i take it off.
jsut give me your body its garuanteed that ima
break you off off off off off until the sun rise,
and im not here to disappoint just give me one try.
one kiss one pinch and you could take it or leave it,
but before you make up your mind just tell me one secret,
ne-yo holla at 'em.
tell me somethin that nobody else knows,
and think about it just as soon as the door closes.
tell me a secret baby,
tell tell tell me a secret baby.
show me somethin that nobody else sees.
tell me all the things you would do if it was you and me,
tell me a secret baby.

so we can talk about your fantasies,
and aint nobody gotta know but me,
baby come on and make this move if you gonna,
baby we grown we can do what we wanna,

baby girl you never know i may like it to,
baby come on and make this move if you gonna,

and think about it just as soon as the door closes.
