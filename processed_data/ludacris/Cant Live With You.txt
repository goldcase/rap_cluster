"can't live with you"
(feat. monica)
i can't live with ya, can't live without you
i say i can't live with ya, can't live without you
ooh i can't live with ya, can't live without you
i can't live with ya, can't live without you
one day i love you, the next i can't stand you
huh, it's too much for me to handle
i made my mind up thinkin i'm on the right track
so then i leave you, but then come right back
and i don't like that, i swear i'm so confused
don't know what i want or what's the right thing to do
but the right thing is you, you're my destiny
even at my worst you still bringin out the best in me
but then you testin me, know how to push my buttons
fussin, fightin, yeah we always gettin into somethin
so mad i make you cry, then we make love
a never-endin cycle, make up to break up
it's time to wake up, i need to smell the coffee
play with these other women, or get 'em all off me
and you wonder why your man'll just doubt ya
can't live with ya, can't live without ya
i can't live with ya, can't live without you
i say i can't live with you, can't live without you
ooh i can't live with ya, can't live without you
the one thing that i know, is i can't seem to let you (go)
you got me to the point of walking out the (door)
and then i find myself coming back for (more)
i don't know what to do
cause i can't live with ya, and can't live without you
one day i love you, the next i can't stand you
huh, it's too much for me to handle
one minute naggin me, always harrassin me
next minute squeezin me, huggin, kissin and grabbin me
just when i think it's cool, you back startin shit
findin the smallest things just to start an argument
goin through my phone, know you shouldn'ta took it though
i hope your stupid ass find what you're lookin fo'
stormin out the house mad, throwin breakin shit
callin your girls, exaggeratin and fakin shit
pack your clothes like you really 'bout to leave this time
know you messed up but actin like it's me this time
it's a revolvin door, that keeps spinnin 'round
are we gon' be together, or are we finished now?
and you wonder why your man'll just doubt ya
can't live with ya, can't live without ya
when the going get tough and the fightin be rough
now some folks may call it hood but i guess we call it love
i be askin for your touch then i don't give you my trust
first i hate you with a passion then i can't need you enough
i be, wantin to spend my whole life wit'chu
and i be, talkin 'bout how you and me are through
and my mind says yes but my heart says no
and my mind says walk but my feet won't go away yeahhhh
see i be tellin you to go
but deep inside i want you to stayyyyy
uh, and you know how to make me smile
but at times you ruin my dayyyyy
ooh, we gotta get better
gotta get it together
and you wonder why your girl just doubt ya
can't live with you, can't live without youuuuu
