"teamwork"
hey we gonna be havin some fun and...
(cause cause cause cause)
cause 2 is better than 1 and...
(some some some some)
some body kill the lights we doin
freaky (freaky) (freaky) (freaky) shit tonight, yaay
double the pleasures like double the fun
how many licks does it take to the center of a luda pop double the tounges
who knows, plus i gotta undress em' caress em' bless em' steady keep em' guessin
if that doesnt impress em' then slower move on to the second lesson
whoo, pantys droppin, body rockin, magnums poppin
its 8 cheeks and 4 titties ya'll better hand me somethin
hey ladies (whoo), on you mark get ready get set go
wait for hours, in an out the shower, this pimp power, we in control
6 hands grippin the sheets, 30 toes are curled
what in the world is goin on till the break a break a dawn wit man and them girls
cause 3 hearts are beatin fast, but only 2 people screamin
we comin together for one cause other than hear ourselves breathin
get in the game n start workin it out n diggin in out
now lean to the side, throw a dick in your mouf
you gotta get in the groove you got nothin to lose
so dont move till you figured it out
and keep makin that face while im rubbin them spots
and we can take turns while the other one watch
and see how she be takin them shots
and wake up the hood till they callin them cops, mayne
now im ready to ride and you can get them tools and you can start the ignition
im grabbin perms, wigs, weaves, ponytails and extensions
not to mention its gonna get, hot, betta come ready to, sweat
i make women cum harder than jacuzzi jets
and im willin to bet that i be keepin it wet cause i feel yah
little bit of ring on the neck it wont kill yah
put me on the top or the bottom and i'll drill yah
given how you wanted to get it to port feel yah
and i'll peel yah, back to back so get ready for the mack attack
they got me takin in some acrobats
the way they bendin it from sack to sack because the mack is back and im gone
