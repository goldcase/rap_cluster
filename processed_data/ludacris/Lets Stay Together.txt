"let's stay together"
everybody breaking, breaking up...
let's stay together, (together )
let's stay together yea!
yea! tell y'all a lil' story right quick man, luda!
first the fat boyz break up,
now everyday i wake up,
somebody done call it quits,
shit i thought bobby and whitney stay together forever if they made it that long,
i guess the drugs weren't that strong
and now it's russel and kimora even jordan and wanita
and to top it off brad left jen for angelina!
what the hell is going on in this world?!
this just can't be! if will and jada can do it, then why can't we?!
hillary is still with bill clinton,
how did they do it? he got his dick sucked and the whole damn world knew it!
now paul mccartney losing half of his life,
all because he got divorced from his wife,
somebody said "it's cheaper to keep her",
but not in k-fed's case (nope!)
'cause britney even had to pay for k-fed's case (cha-ching!) nick and jessica, trina and wayne
and if you broke up with your girl i know you feelin' the pain because...
everybody's breaking, breaking up,
let's stay together (together )
united we stand, divided we fall
let's stay together united we stand, divided we fall common!
everybody's breaking, breaking up,
let's stay together (together )
united we stand, divided we fall
let's stay together united we stand, divided we fall
first it was shaq and kobe (yea), then iverson and philly (yea),
t.o. and mcnabb (yea), even game and 50 (yep!),
i guess sometimes you gotta let the past be the past (past),
but i'd give a hundred thou' to see jay with dame dash,
b.g. with lil' wayne (yea!), juvenile and turk (yea!),
mannie fresh with baby (un huh),
how can we make it work? crunchy with 3-6 (yea!),
diamond with crime mob (yea!), lauryn hill with the fugees (what?!),
remy with terror squad (woo!), lil' kim back with c's and snoop with more dre,
dre with mo-big boys, cd's with mo-plays,
tribes with no quest, salt with no pepa,
even the eagles broke up and got the fuck back together,
selling millions of copies and getting that cash
and raz b said "chris stokes was getting that ass", i don't even understand it,
what the hell went wrong? maybe folks will wise up and take heed to this song because...
everybody's breaking, breaking up,
let's stay together (together )
united we stand, divided we fall
let's stay together united we stand, divided we fall common!
everybody's breaking, breaking up,
let's stay together (together )
united we stand, divided we fall
let's stay together united we stand, divided we fall (i can't take it, oh!)
first wu-tang broke up, now o.d.b. is gone,
now i'm hearing cam'ron don't talk to jim jones,
who would've saw that shit coming?
certainly not me, or tha dogg pound break up, or goodie m-o-b,
then shawnna almost jumped ship from dtp,
if chingy left and came back
then damn it why can't she?
we gotta think us of all for one
and one for all hip hop
united we stand divided we
fall so why is?
everybody breaking, breaking up,
let's stay together (together )
united we stand, divided we fall
let's stay together united we stand, divided we fall come on!
everybody breaking, breaking up,
let's stay together (together )
united we stand, divided we fall
let's stay together united we stand, divided we fall come on!
everybody breaking, breaking up,
let's stay together (together )
united we stand, divided we fall
let's stay together united we stand, divided we fall
