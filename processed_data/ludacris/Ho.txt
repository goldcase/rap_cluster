with ho energy to do whacha do

an why do you think you take a ho to a hotel?

come on playa once a ho always
and hos never close they open like hallways
an heres a ho cake for you whole ho crew
an everybody wants some cuz hoes gotta eat too
cant turn a ho into a housewife
hos dont act right
theres hos on a mission, an hoes on a crackpipe
hey ho how ya doin, where ya been?

its a ho wide world, that we livin in
feline, feminine, fantastical, women
not all, just some

theres hoes in tha room, theres hoes in tha car
theres hoes on stage, theres hoes by tha bar
hos by near, an hos by far
ho! (but can i getta ride?!)
no! (cmon, nigga why?!)
cuz youza
you gotta run in your pantyhos
even your daddy knows
that you suckin down chocolate like daddy-o's
you hos are horrible, horrendous
on taxes ya'll writin off hos as dependents
i see tha ho risin

with ugly chicks faces
but hos dont feel so sad and blue
cuz most of us niggaz is hos too
