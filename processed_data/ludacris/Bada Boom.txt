"bada boom" lyrics
ludacris lyrics
"bada boom"
big bada boom, luda’s in this bitch
pussy niggas clear the room
i came through the door, i said it before
i’m the truth in this bitch and you niggas all hoes
counterfeit rappers say i’m stealing their flows,
but i can’t steal what you never made up bitch
y’all some duplicate rap cloning niggas
i manufacture you hoes put on your makeup bitch
let me explain, nothing’s been new since big daddy kane
flows will get recycled passed around to different names
but what’s the same, that every verse i spit is insane
got more styles than any rapper in the game, 11 years and still counting
and ya’ll get a couple hit records, make some noise and have the nerve to start shouting
who’s gassing ‘em, they blowing smoke up your ass, you fired up but i’m just puff puff passin’ ‘em
until they roaches, buried in my ashtray
nigga burn slow, better pray like it’s your last day
you lying to yourself, just admit it
may not like the way i use it but you know you ain't invent it boy
do your research before you make a claim so bogus
that's disrespecting pioneers in the game
fuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes
then you front line cadets can report to your lieutenants (sir, yes sir)
see i’m ya past, i’m ya future and ya present
so watch ya fucking mouth when you speak about a legend
16 times platinum, 6 number 1′s
so i can give a fuck what you sold in ya first week
you’s weak, softer than the pillsbury dough boy
don’t make me expose the truth, you’s a hoe boy
don’t make me get on that stomp shit and get back at it
you rappers ain't even in my fucking tax bracket
why am i wasting my time
yeah i admit i get a little ludacris with my rhymes, sometimes
but my fans know the difference because “my chick bad” went platinum still winning muthafucka
the nerve of you niggas man, you ain't got enough medals on your jacket to address me boy
fall back in formation, y’all outta line
i was told not to kill a mosquito with a cannon
so the next time you nats got a real problem
don’t be a coward like a nigga that used to be signed to be going on twitter rants and shit
nigga say it to my face
