"new beginning intro" lyrics
ludacris lyrics
"new beginning intro"
yeah, ahh~! i'm ready to do it all over
my heart colder, hip-hop i'm part owner
southern rap specialist, verses intelligent
elegant, it's ludacris, don't ever question my relevance
no pun intended, if no one's offended, get offended
don't get it twisted, guns can get extended
ready to die for my respect, my value, my worth
unequivocal, lyrical beast on every fuckin' verse!
i throw the curse just to stretch the emotions
somebody said i'm washed up, i told 'em "pass me the lotion
cause the industry's dryin' up and these verses are moisturizer
then hand me your favorite rapper and luda will posterize him"
i'm dunkin' over you critics, dozin' off when i'm spittin'
my fans locked behind these bars, i put my life in a sentence
good riddance, i wake 'em up if they step to the plate
cause sleep's the cousin of death and i could never relate!
luda!
see the only people i owe my loyalty to are the ones who made me question it
loyalty goes both ways but never push a loyal person
to the point when they no longer give a fuck
there comes a time in life where you walk away from all the drama
and the people who create that shit - destroy what destroys you!
you'll never see all the great things ahead if you keep lookin' at all the bad things behind you
they say the hardest things in life is know which bridge to cross
and which ones to burn, so may the bridges i burn light yo motherfuckin' way!
("so what's the number one cause of all these problems?")
