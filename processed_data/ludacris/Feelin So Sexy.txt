"feelin' so sexy"
ring...
ring...
hello?
what's up?
what's up baby?
i need you right now...
what you doing?
i'm all alone in my room,
layin' on my bed sheets,
come undress me,
i'm feelin' so sexy...
(you feelin' so sexy?)
i'm feelin' so sexy...
come undress me,
i'm feelin' so sexy...
my body's so tight,
and i'm needin' you to strech me,
come undress me,
i'm feelin' so sexy...
(you feelin' so sexy?)
i'm feelin' so sexy... (ha ha)
come undress me,
i'm feelin' so sexy...
well i'm way over on the south side,
cruisin' in the lac,
but imma make it to your crib,
in about four minutes flat...
keep talkin' how you talkin',
baby what you got on?
i got a black lace bra,
leather boots and a thong,
well i'll be there in a double,
expect when i step through the door
that it's about to be
some mother fuckin' trouble...
oooo what you gonna do?
sweat you out til' you thirsty,
pin your body to the ground,
and have you beggin' for mercy...
oooo baby wait a minute,
you in my head,
if i walk away from dreamin',
i'd see you in my bed,
'til you makin' me uhh...
and you makin' me yeah...
now hurry up and make it to me,
'cause you makin' me wet...
i'm drivin' fast as i can,
baby hold it together,
'cause when i get you in my arms,
imma hold you forever,
get you wet as niagra falls,
a rebel with a cause,
i'll be breakin down the doors,
so tell me where you are...
i'm all alone in my room,
layin' on my bed sheets,
come undress me,
i'm feelin' so sexy...
(you feelin' so sexy?)
i'm feelin' so sexy...
come undress me,
i'm feelin' so sexy...
my body's so tight,
and i'm needin' you to strech me,
come undress me,
i'm feelin' so sexy...
(you feelin' so sexy?)
i'm feelin' so sexy... (ha ha)
come undress me,
i'm feelin' so sexy...
see you got me
eagar as a beaver,
see this the type shit get you
the keys to the beemer,
or some cheese if ya need it ,
'cause you got that good good,
you love it how i beat it
like you stole it
when you throw it
'cause we keep it hood hood,
and i wish you would would,
be my slave for the night,
we can turn the bed room
into my cave for the night...
i'll be your favorite delight,
and make me call you daddy,
while i'm takin' the pipe,
you makin' me bite,
i think you push it too deep,
i need that type of lovein'
that'll put you to sleep,
i wish you could see...
well i can see it if you want me to,
we can get the camera,
we can role play,
you the artist, i'll be ya manager,
you can be the nurse,
i'm the doctor (doc' feel me in),
play cops and robbers,
or cowboy and indians,
in the end,
lets say you won't know what hit cha',
now i'm pullin' in the drive way,
and commin' to get cha'...
i'm all alone in my room,
layin' on my bed sheets,
come undress me,

(you feelin' so sexy?)
i'm feelin' so sexy...
come undress me,
i'm feelin' so sexy...
my body's so tight,
and i'm needin' you to strech me,
come undress me,
