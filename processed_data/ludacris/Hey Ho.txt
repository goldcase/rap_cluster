"hey ho"
(feat. lil kim and lil fate)
if men sleep around we some players but for women
they be saying hey ho
they be saying hey ho
they be saying hey ho
they be saying hey ho
they be saying hey ho
now i be riding in my bentley coupe stuntin with the top down
four 24 inch rims so heavy they hold the block down
24 carrot necklace so heavy it hurt my neck
3 things you can’t take away from me, money, power and respect
i got it and hold on to it you knew that i never let it go
you prostitute it but money i never let it ho
speakin of hoe’s oh yes we meet em and we g’ em dude
and we may see em but we wouldn’t want to be em dude
i put my fist up, i got the power girl
i wash my nuts off, go take a shower girl
it’s been an hour girl, it’s time to go
and if my neighbour see you while you walking out my door (hey ho)
they be saying hey ho
they be saying hey ho
they be saying hey ho
they be saying hey ho
they be saying hey ho
can’t nobody do it like kim
only women that can do it like men
vvs is be them gems
(ho, now count that)
my money coming in
bringing them corners on them rims
so play the check book tell me how do you bounce that
i bounce into position like i am vinegar kama sutra
but money make me come, go and ask luda
and women cheat better than men we don’t disturb them
my motto is "what they don’t know won’t hurt them"
we just do it like you do, see the roles done switched
if i’m a ho you’s a ho, if i’m a bitch you’s a bitch
know that i’ma stay rich so fella’s do what you do
cause you don’t fuck us niggas we fuck you
(hey ho)
now we saying (hey ho)
now we saying (hey ho)
now we saying (hey ho)
now we saying (hey ho)
now we saying (hey ho)
if men sleep around we some players but for women they be saying...
if men sleep around we some players but for women they be saying...
she likes the night lights, brights lights, big spending
lil fate been big pimpin, pimpin
so don’t be mad at my raps and try and look at me funny
cause you know that most you ladies trading sex for money
so if you coming out the pocket then you might get laid
thats how the rent car no the cell phone get paid
i bet the snakes all show once you cut that grass
and i’m a pimp so it’s time that i exploit they ass
you see it’s hoes after the party it’s hoes after the show
it’s hoes up in the lobby, it’s hoes out on the stroll
here’s some no dough, no dough no sleep
ho on your feet, if you don’t work you don’t eat
