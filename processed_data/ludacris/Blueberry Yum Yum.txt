or till i'm stuck and my body feel weak weak weak weak weak
headed down to the dungeon woundren, if they got, some more
and if they don't then ima have ta settle for some droooo
and it just ain't cool cuz i don't have ta, ima have ta gooooo
and continue on my mission fishin for tha yum yum but i'm movin' sloooo
