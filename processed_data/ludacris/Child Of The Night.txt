"child of the night"
(feat. nate dogg)
it's gonna get in ya, child of the night
.. and the hood rolls on
how do i begin to, do this shit right
.. get my hustle on
look here!
now i'm a man of many talents and a man of my word
but on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred
it's all a part of growin up and seein life at it's worst
then tryin to iron out my wrinkles, puttin family first
it seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat
but with god as my navigator i'll be stayin afloat
and i admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions
then i'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions
i'm battlin with myself and every day it's a war
curiosity killed the cat, why am i curious george?
gotta keep my nose up outta thangs that ain't none of my biz
and just cause somethin looks don't really mean that it is
get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife
and take the necessary steps to try to change my life
i got some questions for you lord cause my mentality's hood
so why is everything that's bad for me feel so good?
now i'm a only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways
i got spoiled when i was young, spoil myself today
oh but i feed at least a thousand stomachs and how i've done it
is from the ground up a hundred miles and runnin
dodgin and duckin everybody tryin to hammer me down
a self-made millionaire, baby look at me now
can't tell me nothin still hungry as the day i began
cause all i ever really needed was a pen in my hand
and a, pad in my lap, didn't matter in fact
me and my momma lived in one room, and what's badder than that
was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12
tryin to get in where i fit, streets givin me hell
but yet i give it right - back, so how you like - that
continue doin wrong 'til i was on the right - track
tell me 'bout heavy money i might give it a push
but a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
come on
no matter how much older we get man, we all still children at heart
we all make mistakes, it's all good
now i've tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits
livin life on the cuttin edge, takin a stab at it
and learnin from my mistakes, try not to make 'em twice
just admittin when i'm wrong, tryin hard to make it right
and baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours
there's plenty people gettin stitches in this world of scars
but over time, pray to god that he can heal your wounds
try to love and love again until they seal your tomb
cause life is short if you don't know this it'll pass you by
that's why my head is in the clouds tryin to pass the sky
never blinkin for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes
they wanna catch me in the open, bring my life to a close
meanwhile that's why i'm bringin so much life to my shows
i've seen smiles i'm makin changes turnin glitter to gold
don't let these devils play you down or belittle your soul
just be happy with yo'self and it's so simple to grow
come on
