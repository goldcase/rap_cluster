"nasty girl"
(feat. plies)
a lady in the street but a freak in the bed
lady in the street but a freak in the bed...
lady in the street but a freak in the bed
lady in the street but a freak in the bed
see she makes her own money, pays her own bills
always stays fly, keeps it so real
but behind closed do's she a nasty girl (yup)
behind closed do's she a nasty girl
she got a crazy little figure, nice round ass
walks so proper, talks with such class
but behind closed do's she a nasty girl (yup)
behind closed do's she a nasty girl
yeah, i met this girl named keisha, she was so sweet (yup)
nails stay manicured, pretty little feet (woo!)
shoes so sexy, body so hot
hair lookin like she just came from the shop
legs so smooth, clothes so tight
style so sexy, makeup just right
never too much, never too little
black lace bra, vickie secrets in the middle
eyes so innocent, smile so bright
works in the mornin but she'll party all night
all for her man, all cause she bout it
all cause she crazy in love and don't doubt it
product of her birthplace, know about the streets
clean in the workplace, dirty in the sheets
keeps her own toaster, makes her own bread
lady in the street but a freak in the bed, cause
okay, okay, haha
i got a college girl who go to church e'ry sunday
had her sneak out of choir rehearsal to put it on me
but she's so innocent, when she ridin, mami
one thing about her, she get her own money
gave it to her yesterday while she was doin laundry
favorite chore of mine, it's my lil' bunny
bowl-legged and classy, such a real woman
sex all night, go to work e'ry mornin
text me from work and told me she was horny
text her back and told her, "me too mami"
when you get off work, daddy gon' punish
you my nasty girl forever i promise
i got a doctor girlfriend that tells me, "come home soon!"
she plays like my house is her emergency room
tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa
checks all my vitals like a doc's supposed ta
all white coat, all white heels
and nothin underneath so it's an all night deal
i'm her number one patient and delighted to be
and when she needs her medicine i give her vitamin d
but wait! i got a lawyer girl that's so wild
and every single night she wanna take me to trial
said she needs some evidence, and to show her the proof
so i put her on the stand and i give her the truth!
cause i'm hung like a jury (jury)
judge luda preside over your body and i'm never in a hurry
you may proceed, let the games begin
and if i call a mistrial we gotta do it again
