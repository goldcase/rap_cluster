"hopeless" lyrics
ludacris lyrics
"hopeless"
ooooh you feel that as i take you to them dirt roads deep in your southern roots
when nobody said life was going to be easy and we travel to this emotional roller coaster called life
and we have our ups and downs
just keep in mind
when you hit rock bottom
there aint no where to go but up baby
just all you about how you deal wit it you feel me.. listen here
when life seems hopeless
it make a nigga lose focus
empty beer bottles and roaches, helps to get it off my chest cause
im so stressed and all i here is "fuck tha world"
man ever since life been a gamble
my life been in shamblez
double edge sword burnin both sides of the candle but cris but you cant handle the truth
dont wanna face reailty
so lord accept my apology
please like when police say freeze
and i aint do shit
but im down on my knees
its a crooked system but gin straight take the pain away i charge the game
and put my problems on layaway
a black man but i feel so blue
so i smoke green and purple til my dreams come true
then my eyes turn red
sky turns grey
children slangin white in the hood
we call it yaay drink old gold
down my yellow brick road
then rewrite my script til my story is untold
see i got a little money and my life sped up now
im fallin and i cant get up
i had to dream about a dope fiend
and its strange cause he can bearly write or read but seems to get folkz about anything curious about him
i wanted to talk to him but he was to busy fo that
but i was more then welcome to walk with him
as we walked
he talked and i just listen
he said theres a big differnce between crackas and niggas
see he said white folks look out fo the white folks but uh black folks blang wit tha black folks
when they aint enough black roakz
when you ooh to make a long story short
we need pay more attenion and do things that are more compleset and he told me
you kno i woulldnt say something that wouldnt work and i wouldnt damnwaste my time telling something that would hurt you
but you would fall for anything
if you dont stand for something
but thats for certain but niggas dont be listen and that shit be hurting
no all of us but some of us
and if we dont hurry up
they going to bury each and every one of us
and if we dont hurry up
sometimes i cant deal wit my daily issues
just being sober lifes a bitch and i cant control her
i wish i could and sometimes to cry on
we need a shoulder
the goverment stand us up
to run us over
and in the hood they dont seem to understand
god damn whats really got me wondering
is if its a part of a bigger plan man
i smell some thing fishy goin on and its way beyond blowin away the smoke from these swisher
goin on it aint much i can do about it but preach the word of telling my people to spend ya money wisely dont be obcared
by some things that depresiated like what like a home to open ya eyes to
whats the fucks thats goings on cause the constantly getting rid of us one by one wither its drugs or diesase or gun by
gun i aint no saint either i feel that im even doing wrong by usein this chorus to get thru this song
you know yall going to mess around and complain about slavery that was over 40 50 years ago black folks need to move on
yall keep playin wit a crackerthey going to have yo ass tied up wired up to them back roads south florida and they made
them laws say they cant do anything for you can a church get a amen and god for the thugs.
