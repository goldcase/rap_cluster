"if i aint f'd up"
i been drinkin' all night
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel right
if i
ain't fucked up i don't feel right
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel
right
i been smokin' all night
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel
right
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel right
if i ain't fucked up i don't
feel right
conjure straight up on the rocks i don't chase shit
real nigga man, your crew be on that fake shit
when it come to getting slizzered, man i hold the belt
swimming pool full of liquor, bitch i'm michael phelps
drowning all you non-drinkers, non-smokers,
non-dippers, non-poppers
babysitter drinking thinking that you might have to go see a doctor
stop the bullshittin', i let these punks know
if you ain't turnt, what the fuck you in the club for?
these niggas must be bout that life, bitch you damn right
get out my section, off my couch and out my damn sight
ever since i left the crib, i hit the ground running
tell the waitress keep
them motherfucking bottles coming
i been drinkin' all night
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel
right
if i
ain't fucked up i don't feel right
if i ain't fucked up i don't
feel
right
i been smokin' all night
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel
right
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel right
if i ain't fucked up i
don't
feel right
the be like luda looking rough, but his rhymes smooth
i'm in the studio, i gotta get my mind skewed
give me that cup, give me that
blunt, give me that sticky green
give me that light, give me that sprite, and that promethazine
sippin' slow, no ho, i'm not in no rush bitch
don't tell my doctor, let's just keep this on the hush bitch
i'm on another level, these niggas on the floor
they be like who's luda's suplier, bitch you'll never know
top notch, top tier, i'm a top nigga
slap her bottom while your girlfriend give me top nigga
told her listen, you should gargle more, and speak less
we took some shots
and turned that shit into a drink fest
i been drinkin' all night
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel right
if i
ain't fucked up i don't feel right
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel
right
i been smokin' all night
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel
right
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel right
if i ain't fucked up i don't
feel right
i can't think straight
take a smoke break
get the blood
goin', goin'
light it up and
smoke somethin'
smoke somethin'
smoke
somethin'
smoke somethin'
i can't think straight
take a drink
break
get the cup goin', goin'
fill it up
drink somethin'
drink
somethin'
drink somethin'
drink somethin'
i been drinkin' all night
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel right
if i
ain't fucked up i don't feel right
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel
right
i been smokin' all night
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel
right
if i ain't fucked up i don't feel right
if i ain't fucked up i don't
feel right
