"she said"
(feat. fate wilson)
she said she never done it, she said she never tried
she's sittin there tellin a motherfuckin lie
she said she was a christian and she grew up in the church (in the church)
would stay a virgin if for better or for worse (or for worse)
had plenty friends and got offers all the time (all the time)
swore up and down she was just one of a kind (of a kind)
she said she's loved, but she's never gotten pimped (gotten pimped)
not dominated couldn't imagine, never dreamt (never dreamt)
and though she steady looking for the perfect man (perfect man)
to buy a ring and take her motherfucking hand (man)
she said her stuff was sacred, and her momma told her so (told her so)
and that she went and got it pierced on the low (on the low)
can you believe she's been waiting for so long?(for so long)
to get a grade a certified shlong (certified shlong)
she said her parents never let her out the house (out the house)
because they knew it was so dirty in the south (in the south)
she hates to boast, and you know she hates to brag (hates to brag)
but, man i gotta let her cat up out the bag (out the bag)
she said she never tried to take it in the butt (in the butt)
but, knew some ho down all around sluts (all around sluts)
she even said she never licked another girl (another girl)
and never had any chocolate, vanilla swirl (vanilla swirl)
she said that ring up in her tongue was for show (was for show)
and she would never be mistaken for a hoe (for a hoe)
she telling lies over 20 years old (20 years old)
i guess the game is to be sold, not told (whoa!)
she said she had a nigga who was only there for rent (there for rent)
and wouldn't shake her booty for a red cent (red cent)
she said she never fucked 3 niggas at a time (at a time)
til lil fate started fuckin with her mind (with her mind)
she said she couldn't see how women turn tricks (turn tricks)
and couldn't picture tryna suck a nigga dick (suck a dick)
she had respect, and wouldn't do nothing wrong (nothing wrong)
but, she the reason why we made this song (this song)
she's said she never done it
