"dancin dirty"
(feat. chris brown)
heeeeeeeeeee... leggo
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty on the flow 'cause she know a nigga watchin
dirty on the flow 'cause she know a nigga watchin
she with her friends – they might go
they poppin ass like they poppin bottles
i'm with my niggas, we got dough
so bend that ass for this cash on the flow... leggo
shake that, shake it like you mean it
you take another shot, me and yo girl gon double-team it
she drop it to the floor like i ain't even never seen it
and runnin that dirty mouth like i ain't even tryna clean it
so i... grab a cup, fill it to the brim
then hand you a night cap and say we going for a swim
later on at the crib-o, hard as an armadillo
she say she think she love me so i told that bitch dido
flexin these georgia bitches, then let em right off they leashes
they thinkin i'm so feciscious til i beat that pussy to pieces
i'm checkin they facial features, they shakin like some sort of seizure
and thinkin i'm some sort of hater,
hatin alien, nice to meet ya
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty on the flow 'cause she know a nigga watchin
dirty on the flow 'cause she know a nigga watchin
she with her friends – they might go
they poppin ass like they poppin bottles
i'm with my niggas, we got dough
so bend that ass for this cash on the flow... leggo
throw it, throw it like you know it
these girls be actin shy but you just ain't afraid to show it
i got all this money and i'm down, so fun to blow it
'cause she ask me for a drink and i'm down, so fun to bow it
i'm a make it strong, she says she like it fruity
in another 30 minutes i be feelin on her booty
an hour after that i'll have her twisted like a cyclone
legs wrapped around me til she squeeze me like a python
i call that sizzle, we both been gone off that liquor
she let down all her defenses, and yes i give her the business
with a quickness she came to her senses
well i'm choppin and snappin pictures
relentless but so persistent
now she said it's just ludacris
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty on the flow 'cause she know a nigga watchin
dirty on the flow 'cause she know a nigga watchin
she with her friends – they might go
they poppin ass like they poppin bottles
i'm with my niggas, we got dough
so bend that ass for this cash on the flow... leggo
pop it, pop it like a stripper
pop it like a soda can, pop it for a snicker
pop it for these fast balls, throw it like a picture
when the waitress yellin last call – drop it on a nigga, blah
this girl's bomber, flew her to puntacana
we sippin on some coladas
i'm takin off her pajamas
she nasty, with a nice persona
she bitin me like piranha
the model, the girlfriend dumber
she must get it from her mama
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty - she dancing dirty
she dancing dirty on the flow 'cause she know a nigga watchin
dirty on the flow 'cause she know a nigga watchin
she with her friends – they might go
they poppin ass like they poppin bottles
i'm with my niggas, we got dough
so bend that ass for this cash on the flow... leggo
