"sex room"
(feat. trey songz)
welcome to my little sanctuary
you've been looking so good all day
and you really got a nigga pretty anxious baby
better call your boss tell him that your daddy's home
take a couple days off
and take it off and leave nothing but your t-shirts and your panties on
feeling high but i'm hung real low looking sorta like a tripod,
so power down your cell phone and power up your ipod
power down your inhibitions and power up your inner freak
(yes... fuck)
it's the only words that you finna speak
its about to get real x-rated
can you handle what i'm 'bout to do
but enough about me let me think
should i be worrying about if i can handle you
damn right i'ma get that thing and i'ma put my name on it
all night i'ma whip that thing, all state better put a claim on it
i claim my territory, my tongue finna mark you up
you could be my fire cracker, my tongue gon spark you up
get ready for blast off, waterfalls gon splash off
you might lose around 4 or 5 pounds so get ready to sweat your ass off
welcome to my sex room
where your body meets my body
its our private afterparty
if you want it girl i got it in my sex room
candles and a pole sets your body to your soul
from the bed down to the floor, sex room
mirrors in the head board, even got a camcord
baby won't you dance in my sex room
welcome to my sex room
where your body meets my body
its a private afterparty
if you want it girl i got it
in my sex room
let the candles burn, imma turn these lights down
and when your body gets hot, it'll get you licked up and iced down
nipples hard as rocks, lips as soft as cotton
your the apple of my eye, and i got you spoiled rotten
i'mma get my video camera, lets make a movie baby
you the star so as soon as i press record you got's to do me baby
you can stare all in the mirror, take a pic at how good you looking
imma have your body smoking, take a look at what luda's cooking
my arm underneath your leg leg
or behind your head is how i gots to get ya
right hand left hand all red in the bed like we've been playing twister
now i've got you tangled up and you caught all in my web
should i let you loose nah
i think i'll get the blindfold instead
you better get a couple towels baby
cos we about to slip and slide
you don't ever need a horse or saddle
i'mma give you this dick to ride
i'mma grant your every wish and fulfill your fantasy
aint nobody else allowed in the sex room
it's only you and me
