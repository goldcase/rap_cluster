"my chick bad"
(feat. nicki minaj)
my chick bad
my chick hood
my chick do stuff dat ya chick wish she could
my chick bad, badder than yours
my my chick bad, badder than yours
my my my chick bad, badder than yours
i’m saying my chick bad
my chick hood
my chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
my chick bad, badder than yours
my chick do stuff that i can’t even put in words
her swagger don’t stop
her body won’t quit
so fool pipe down you ain’t talkin bout shit
my chick bad, tell me if you seen her
she always bring the racket like venus and serena
all white top, all white belt
and all white jeans, body looking like milk
no time for games, she’s full grown
my chick bad, tell your chick to go home
now your girl might be sick but my girl sicker
she rides that dick and she handles her liquor
she knock a bitch out and fight
coming out swinging like tiger woods wife
yeah she could get a little hasty
chicks better cover up there chests like pasty’s
couple girl friends and they all a little crazy
coming down the street like a parade macy’s
i fill her up balloons
test her and guns get drawn like cartoons
doh, but i aint talkin bout homer
chick so bad the whole crew wanna bone her
yo, now all these bitches wanna try and be my bestie
but i take a left and leave them hanging like a testi
trash talk to em then i put em in a hefty
running down the court i'm dunkin on em lisa leslie.
it’s going down, basement, friday the 13th guess who’s playing jason
tuck yourself in you better hold on to your teddy
it’s nightmare on elm street and guess who’s playing freddy
(my chick bad)
chef cooking for me, they say my shoe game crazy
the mental asylum looking for me
you a rookie to me
i’m in dat wam bam purple lam’ damn bitch you been a fan.
