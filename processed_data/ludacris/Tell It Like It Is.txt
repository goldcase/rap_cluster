"tell it like it is"
things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be
like all these fakin' ass rappers in this industry
talkin' bout what they got, and they ain't got a damn thang
how you own three cars, but you don't own ya own name?
get ya business right boys, the first class is in session
get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession
start up ya own company, trademark the name
that's gon' run ya bout a grand so start savin' ya change
open a bank account quick, and then follow these steps
sign yourself to yourself and start signin' ya own checks
hit the booth and start recording at the speed of need
whatever gets ya juices flowin' could be speed or weed
get it mixed and mastered, pressed up and plastered
sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard!
show all the non-believers what you destined to be
and in just a couple years you could be rich like me
but i can't hold my tounge
i'ma tell it like it is
this biz ain't all fun
i'ma tell it like it is
give it to ya straight, no chase
i'ma tell it like it is
look you straight in yo face
and i'ma tell it like it is
i can't hold my tounge
i'ma tell it like it is
this biz ain't all fun
i'ma tell it like it is
give it to ya straight, no chase
i'ma tell it like it is
look you straight in yo face
and i'ma tell it like it is
see, mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems
the money could be the problem, but money can't solve 'em
some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy
some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy
i'm close 'cause those close wanna live off my fame
and that type of shit alone will drive a nigga insane
not to mention all the vultures, the scandelous promoters
crabs will try to sue ya, magazines will misquote ya
most of these label-heads, they don't care nothin' about ya
if you stop sellin' records, they'll act like they don't know ya
it's hard mixin' business with pleasure, so don't play
me and my crew argue and fight like every other day
rappers ain't above the law, but our life is so fast
that we got a special task force of police on our ass
all that, and this is really just the start of it
hip hop, you really wanna be a part of it?
i can't hold my tounge
i'ma tell it like it is
this biz ain't all fun
i'ma tell it like it is
give it to ya straight, no chase
i'ma tell it like it is
look you straight in yo face
and i'ma tell it like it is
i can't hold my tounge
i'ma tell it like it is
man this biz ain't all fun
i'ma tell it like it is
i'ma give it to ya straight, no chase
i'ma tell it like it is
look you straight in yo face
and i'ma tell it like it is
what's worse than havin' no money is havin' it and losin' it
what's worse than havin' some money is grabbin' and abusin' it
we never took no money from chingy, thought i was cool wit him
i wish his ass well, but i don't want nothin' to do with him!
some don't own they publishin', me i never fool wit 'em
i'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em
'cause outside my label competition is irrelevant
unless i'm still in competition with my president
and believe that i'm supportin' the hova
''cause the industry's shady, it needs to be taken over'
but the first rule to accumalation of wealth
is don't trust nobody but ya god damned self!
i can't hold my tounge
i'ma tell it like it is
man this biz ain't all fun
i'ma tell it like it is
i'm give it to ya straight, no chase
i'ma tell it like it is
look you straight in yo face
and i'ma tell it like it is
i said i can't hold my tounge
i'ma tell it like it is
this biz ain't all fun
i'ma tell it like it is
give it to ya straight, no chase
i'ma tell it like it is
look you straight in yo face
and i'ma tell it like it is
