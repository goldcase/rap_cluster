"do sumthin strange"
(feat. rick ross)
well, well, what do we have here?
still getting pussy from that gift i gave her last year
but it's a new day, she want a macbook
so i showed her how the backseat of a 'lac look
she talking handbags and gucci slippers
she serve me like a waiter and all i can do is tip her
talking about she needs some gas money
you better hop upon that pole and shake that ass for me
oh, hoe stop acting all boogie
knowing you give it up for church's chicken and a movie
big bucks, i got them
it's amazing what they'll do for a pair of them red bottoms
yeah, she says she needs some rent money
i told her hop upon this dick for me
she says she need to pay her condo
yeah, well i need some daddy long stroke
she asked me about her phone bill
i asked her to show me just how that dope feel
she says she need to pay tuition
well drop down to the floor and assume the fucking position
do something strange for a little piece of change
do something strange for a little piece of change
do something strange for a little piece of change
do something strange for a little piece of change
i told her, uh, uh jerome is in the house bitch
fuck the bed, we bout to stay right on this couch bitch
i told her if she hit it right
i'll buy that iphone 32 gigabytes
oh, but now you say you want an ipad
well get naked bring your ass over to my pad
need some helping moving out your old place
i need some help showing you my old face
now you need a backstage pass though
well i need some backstage ass hoe
get with it, will keep your stingy tail then
what a little head will get you hair and your nails did
yeah, she says she needs some rent money
i told her hop upon this dick for me
she says she need to pay her condo
yeah, well i need some daddy long stroke
she asked me about her phone bill
i asked her to show me just how that dope feel
she says she need to pay tuition
well drop down to the floor and assume the fucking position
do something strange for a little piece of change
do something strange for a little piece of change
do something strange for a little piece of change
do something strange for a little piece of change
she super sexy so i treat her to my wing stop
i'm trying to whip my dick and shoot off like a slingshot
we run the games all my whole fucking team hot
my job down and the same with your dream bout
i keep a pocket full of franks, time to work my magic
my safe similar to a bank, better check the balance
spray the chevrolet red like it's from cincinnati
baby giving me head with superior talent
i pay for that pussy like it's a rented car
i ring the phone, i grab it, all up in that car
take her to a spot she's never been in life
the niggers loosers me and luda in the winner slot
yeah, she says she needs some rent money
i told her hop upon this dick for me
she says she need to pay her condo
yeah, well i need some daddy long stroke
she asked me about her phone bill
i asked her to show me just how that dope feel
she says she need to pay tuition
well drop down to the floor and assume the fucking position
do sumthin strange for a little piece of change
do sumthin strange for a little piece of change
do sumthin strange for a little piece of change
do sumthin strange for a little piece of change.
