ludacris lyrics
"game got switched"
i hate it when it's too many niggaz, not enough hoes
too many rookies, not enough pros
the game got switched on some ludacris shit
so all y'all can suck my dick, beotch!!
i got a whip like miracle ludacris lyrical fool
we dirty south shut yo' mouth we rock jewels
no holds barred but obey the block rules
cock tools put chlorine in record pools
are there anyone like ya (hell naw!!)
i treat humans like students (fail y'all)
so turn ya books to page 69 and start suckin
when organized drop the tracks then start duckin
when ludacris get in the bed start fuckin
you wanna be startin some'n
get out the booth
and lemme tell y'all the truth, we kick down do's
save all the h20 for front rows
live in the bank and watch for stank hoes
stay chromed out and that's on or off road
if you know what i mean proceed to stay clean
light skinded nigga turn red but get green
inhale some of that 'dro but blow steam
love a combination big ass and tight jeans
boy you done lost yo' mind
no i've lost my virginity
and i shot click like that fool shot kennedy
what's the remedy hennessey coke
if you cut all your money you'd still be half broke
ashes to ashes smoke or get smoked
we come by the masses you come and get choked
if you take me for a fool i'll take you for a joke
tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
so now we eatin lobster shrimp and things
and watch for imposters that's been in the game
we invented the game and y'all just got hip
man what's that smell
probably yo upper lip
cause i love to walk around like my shit don't stank
even if it's cigars and that purple color dank
chillin in the gut with no trace of tom hanks
so put this in yo' jaw like weiners and beef franks
i put too much sugar in my kool..aid
and party like a kid wit a high top fade
arrive to a show and i like to get paid
arrive to a hoe and i like to get laid
ride up on my back like rugs and floormats
i'm on the right page but what's my format
i wave to the ocean cause i'm where shores at
and women go nuts just like my bozack
did you know that?  man i'm the gift of change
electric stoves so give me the keys to the range
shagadelic, beautiful but strange
went to magic city saw nikki and blue flames
rearrange, same broad different night
pass the e&j and let a nigga get right
the bomb threaten dude that's on yo same flight
the highlight's that i live a high ass life
