"runaway love"
(feat. mary j. blige)
runaway love
runaway love
runaway love
runaway love
runaway love
runaway love
runaway love
runaway love
now little lisa is only 9 years old
she's trying to figure out why the world is so cold
why she's all alone and ain't never met her family
mama's always gone and she never met her daddy
part of her is missing and nobody will listen
mama is on drugs getting high up in the kitchen
bringing home men at different hours of the night
starting with some laughs - usually ending in a fight
sneaking in her room while her mama's knocked out
trying to have his way and little lisa says 'ouch'
she tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
tries to tell her mom but her mama don't believe her
lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
forced to think that hell is a place called home
nothing else to do but get some clothes and pack
she says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.
runaway love
little nicole is only 10 years old
she's steady trying to figure why the world is so cold
why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
alcoholic step-dad always wanna strike her
yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
teachers ask questions she making up excuses
bleeding on the inside, crying on the out
it's only one girl really knows what she about
her name is little stacy and they become friends
promise that they always be tight 'til the end
until one day little stacy gets shot
a drive by bullet went stray up on her block
now nicole stuck up in the world on her own
forced to think that hell is a place called home
nothing else to do but get her clothes and pack
she says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.
runaway love
little erica is eleven years old
she's steady trying to figure why the world is so cold
so she pops x to get rid of all the pain
plus she's having sex with a boy who's sixteen
emotions run deep and she thinks she's in love
so there's no protection he's using no glove
never thinking 'bout the consequences of her actions
living for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
the days go by and her belly gets big
the father bails out he ain't ready for a kid
knowing her mama will blow it all outta proportion
plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
erica is stuck up in the world on her own
forced to think that hell is a place called home
nothing else to do but get her clothes and pack
she say she's about to run away and never come back.
runaway love
don't keep on runnin'
runnin'
don't keep on running
i know how you feel, i've been there
i was runnin' away too
i will run away with you
runaway runaway love
don't keep running away
i'll run away with you, if you want me too
yeah, i can only imagine what you're going through ladies,
sometimes i feel like running away myself,
so do me a favor right now and close your eyes,
and picture us running away together,
when we come back everything is gonna be okay,
open your eyes...
