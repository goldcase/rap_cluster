"save it for another day"
ey! save it for another day
i ain't try to hear that shit, no way
hold up, let me take two sips
and you can can miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
hold up, let me take two sips
and you can can miss me with that bullshit
you look like an a 8 figya nigga
gone off the liquor
and i'm fired up like the booty of a swisha
make the trunk shake like a california quake
and everywhere i go these bitches tryna take my pictcha
all white beama accentuated features
talk around the rim like a fucking margarita
cops profiling but i'm still wildin' hoping that they never find this cannibis sativa
toke in moderation like niggers on probation
i break it like a record then i put it on rotation
pass it like a test cause the system got me stressed
so when they stop me askin for license and registration
i'm like
ey! save it for another day
i ain't try to hear that shit, no way
hold up, let me take two sips
and you can can miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
hold up, let me take two sips
and you can can miss me with that bullshit
yeah, pass the lighta i'm rollin like a tire
yeah we bout to blow i got that bomb like al queda
the streets is not at ease so i keep a desert e
and any given day you get that cannon like mariah
yeah i rock the cradle, drop you like your label
i got so fired up some illegal like my cable
try me and you wishin for a gang of ammunition
i'm handy with this cap people thinkin i'm disabled
couple ladies with me cause i'm long like pippy
so you'll just find yourself like a minaj like nicki
a sucka for them curves went over a billion serves
i said bitch! get on deez and i ain't talkin about micky
she said
ey! save it for another day
i ain't try to hear that shit, no way
hold up, let me take two sips
and you can can miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
hold up, let me take two sips
and you can can miss me with that bullshit
problem's ova, driving on the shoulda
bass booms trunk got that thunda like oklahoma
woofers on them tweets my accura's got beats
my kicka's go hard, yeah my speakers got a boner
crome kitted 5% tinted on the highway gettin head i told her push me to the limit
she got my balls sprung like a i hit a homerun
she make her mouth stretch like the fuckin 7th inning
so it, one, two, three strikes you outta there luda got em playing with theyself like solitaire
birds of a feather supposed to stick togetha
but sick of women saying they friend look like halle berry
i'm like
ey! save it for another day
i ain't try to hear that shit, no way
hold up, let me take two sips
and you can can miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
miss me with that bullshit
hold up, let me take two sips
and you can can miss me with that bullshit
