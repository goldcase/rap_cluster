"this has been my world"
over a decade later
let's toast to the good life
we still living the hood life
welcome to my world ludaversal!
listen
i think i got the best job in the world
cuz i ain't gotta take the piss test
michael sending me jordans every 1st of the month
said his kids love me, ain't paid for a pair of kicks since
why is it that when 'em niggas gettin' rich
the whole world just wanna get you some free shit? (hahah)
ain't that 'bout a bitch
especially when they told me i'll never do shit, or be shit
i made it and never took you for granted
took off and i never landed, supply whatever demanded and no one's ever handed it to me
i kicked it off with me and my special team and shot the  to me
touchdown on my old turf, money and bitches sucking me in my microphone vest
and know i'm not surprised that my old  taking niggas to school, go do your homework
yeah, and i been going around in circles
like everyday is a rehearsal
is my life your entertainment?
this has been my world, ludaversal
this has been my world, ludaversal
this has been my world, ludaversal
my life your entertainment
this has been my world, ludaversal
almost everyday i'm waking up in another city
another country, a different climate and a time zone
jet lag but i'm out of the bed fast for bad foreign bitches that i'm eager to lay my eyes on
so i opened up the blinds to the sky on
wish that i could talk to god on my iphone
i thank him for all of his generosity
and for satisfying most of my curiosity
fans asking me what it's like to be me
i always tell 'em it's more good than bad
they say i want what you got
i tell 'em you'll never have shit if you don't appreciate what you have
so i have learned to appreciate all the simple things
like some good head and a fine wine
we all going through life searching for answers
and i been all around the world trynna find mine
yeah, and i been going around in circles
like everyday is a rehearsal
is my life your entertainment?
this has been my world, ludaversal
this has been my world, ludaversal
this has been my world, ludaversal
my life your entertainment
this has been my world, ludaversal
seems like everyday is a holiday
celebratory popping bottles and model days
stereotypical rap shit personified
from 8 albums committin' lyrical homicide
these airports like international mazes
now my passport needs additional pages
then i'm staring out at another horizon
staying fly even in the no fly zone
bodies on board but my mind's gone
ain't no better feeling than when i fly home
staring out the window of the plane in the rains even the clouds need a shoulder to cry on
i'm crying cuz i'm living out my dreams
but this life is not easy as it seems
it's sorta similar to a crack game
ain't no slowing down when you living in the fast lane
yeah, and i been going around in circles
like everyday is a rehearsal
is my life your entertainment?
this has been my world, ludaversal
this has been my world, ludaversal
this has been my world, ludaversal
my life your entertainment
this has been my world, ludaversal!
life is a gift
and we have a responsibility to live it
from the first breath to the last
our future is built on the foundation of our past
experience is a professor, and its test's at a highest pressure
while we can't afford to crack
we must bear not to break
like a reed in the wind we go with the flow
while still reaching for the light
avoid useless conflict while never running from the fight
the struggle that forever brought me to just beneath the surface
i'm dedicating to the service of self and to my people
and to never feeding the beast of unnecessary evil
we say the motion of
take the action to display our character
from the first second that we start to feast until the day that we break this barrier
so disparaging is a civilized savage only strive to become average
i'm not happier as a maverick
a cowboy that uses his cabbage to get more green than most millions done seen
the good kind and never the bad bitch
the best that life has to give are the blessings of this life that we live
and everyday i'm  not lose my way i've had to learn
just remember in any existence it's not the destination but the journey
live your life
just blaze!
