"how low"
how - low - can you go? how - low, can you go?
how - low - can you go? how - low, can you go?
how - low - can you go? how - low, can you go?
how - low - can you go? how - low, can you go?

how - low - can you go? how - low, can you go?
how - low - can you go? how - low, can you go?
how - low - can you go? how - low, can you go?
hahaha, luda!
she can go lower than i ever really thought she could - face down - {ass up!}
the top of yo' booty jigglin outcho' jeans, baby pull yo' pants up!
i like it when i see you do it, better than i've ever seen i done befo'
a lot of, women, drop it to the ground, but how - low - can you go?
lower, than yo', mama's, ever, seen it, in her, life-time
never, would of i-magined it, not even in her right mind
practice in front of that mirror, now you, doin it, on the dance flo'
mad 'cause i can't get wit you, "chick, just show me how to dance" {ohh!!!}
i may not wanna get low, so i'm posted up kinda like a playa do
but if you come to the crib, then i'll might show you girls a thang or two
yeah, i think you a superstar, wit a ass like that you gotta blow
befo' you make it big, there’s just one thing that i gotta know
how - low - can you go? how - low, can you go?
how - low - can you go? how - low, can you go?
how - low - can you go? how - low, can you go?
how - low - can you go? how - low, can you go?
i can go looooooow (go low), lower than you know
go looooooow (go looow), l-l-l-lower than you know
go looooooow (go loow), l-l-l-lower than you know
go looooooow (go looow), l-l-l-lower than you know
i be like knick, knack, patty, wack
oh, where my kitty cat? give a dog a bone
how many licks does it take 'til i get
to the center and let a realla nigga take you home?
i can make this show, {stop} soon as he hear this fo', {pop}
from a-t-l-a-n-t-a and all the way down to yo', {block}
(ohhh!!!) put the needle on the record
and i make her get lower than a lamborghini
and if she really get low, then i'ma shoot a video and put it all on tv
(oh!!) 'cause i like that french vanilla (french vanilla)
and the caramel (and the caramel)
but when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate),
i know that very well (i know that very well)
asian persuasion, no discrimination, i love how they seem to please us
i wanna taste them butter rican pecan peanut butter cups like reese's pieces (oh!!)
'cause i think you a superstar, wit a ass like that you gotta blow
befo' you make it big, there’s just one thing that i gotta knoooooow...
drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
don’t, stop - {get it, get it}
put it in reverse just to back it up
let me put some luda in it
show me whatchu workin with, i’ll show you some of this bank, roll
yeah you a superstar, there's just one thing i gotta know
so...
