"rock and a hard place"
yeah yeah
it's an everyday stuggle
trying to get out
trying to get out
trying to make it
check this out nigga
what
i'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
bad luck is what resluts from my paper chase
i keep looking it ain't no dough
so i don't wanna look no mo what
i need to get away to another day or place in time
and find where reality can ease my mind
and shine on me like the sons of the earth
for what it's worth my turf is ruff and rugged so i gave birth
to a dream where cream lies between
all the dirt and the gravel so i battle to achieve my green
and still try to move forward at a steady pace
cause bad luck is interfering with my paper chase
so i erase the crime lies and sad cries
wit sore eyes and keep mines on the uprise
but it don't work cause im steady getting jerked
by my neighborhood up to no good where bad niggas lurk
the urk me leaving effects that's too negative
so ludacris is looking for a better place to live
and i can't stand it it's really got me buggin
it's like im in the war and i just keep on tuggin cause i'm
i try to find a way outta this maze
it's got me crazed im in a daze
so many ways to boost into a different phase
but i can't think i can't do nothing
you think i'm fronting
you hear me grunting
lord you ain't even saying nuttin
i need some currency before there's an emergency
forget crimes i won't let my mind get the best of me
it's not gone happen i'm trapped in two worlds
on one side i see diamonds on the other i see pearls
it's a whirlwind disaster with two damn sides
so i'm gone with the wind and come right back with the tide
cause i keep my eyes on the skies and my head in the clouds
and when my mouth is shut up it makes my thoughts get loud
it's like a crowd in a stadium
mils i be craving em
money making schemes locked up in my cranium
cause i need outta this critical situation
my mind's in jail i don't know the time that it's facing i'm
i'm sick of knockin i'm sick of clocking
i'm sick of droppin in a hole never reaching my goal
it's got my soul seperated into pieces
it just increases
i'm hit wit anger like a cooked tit wit hot greases
so if you understood my attitude
maybe you feel what i'm feeling
and then it start appealing
to ya intellect and aspect of dreams and aspirations
death by temptations even got my heart basting
so i'm tracing the line where i can find a better path
and make it last sit back and laugh before the aftermath
the tragic flaw is what makes it raw
so let it fall and i'll get through it even if i have to crawl
my way, i see the sun and there's no delay
and i'ma pray cause the lord will make a brighter day
or will he keep me in his holding cell
but enough wit the questions the only story to tell
is that i'm
