"all bad"
sunday morning i'm off at church
sinnin' throughout the week, hustlin' every day
gettin' it as we speak, listen to preacher preach
choir singing the song, annie clapping her hands
momma singing along, i'm impatient i wanna leave
can't let my momma see, i ain't listening to the word
not like i don't believe, but i'm trippin' nobody perfect
to speak it wouldn't worth it for a person to be so christ like
but i swear, i heard him cursin'
let him without no sins cast the first stone
but i am so not him so let me go on on
get home and he will find his hat on
who's family when this all went on
come on, let's see, some laughs, then we
can do the same damn thing next week
i love it when it happens like that
i smile cause it's not all bad
you know they say that no one's perfect
that's why we struggle every day
just know that every single day is a blessing
i'm just tryna find my way
i keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
keep your head above water
cause it ain't all bad
monday mornin' it's back to business
cash the motivation, cops steady watchin'
plottin' and waiting patient
yeah i been thinkin' lately
prayin' on even maybe
probably best if i left it
the stress will drive you crazy if you let it
the penitentiary is where were headed
designed for downfalls and some still don't get it
and yeah i might have said it way back and got sweated by
the same ones that hittin' it now but no credit came to me
if you can see the things i see
then you could point your fingers at the blame not me
ashamed how we can't stand one another
we hate the idea of a unified young brother so we suffer
but i adapt cause i'm a hustler
i still stay strapped with the muffler
i'm ten toes trapped in the struggle cause
i'm what the hood made mothafucka what
you know they say that no one's perfect
that's why we struggle every day
just know that every single day is a blessing
i'm just tryna find my way
i keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
keep your head above water
cause it ain't all bad
as solid these niggas come, realist they ever made
money is not important it's livin' it how you say
picture back in the day, me moving a brick a week
murdered you if i had to nigga i'm from the streets
and out here were playing for keeps, speak and your getting froze
neck gettin' wrapped in sheets, sneakers will be exposed
this bullet here for your soul
bitches is just for sex, that said i could jack my dick
she don't deserve respect, i'm knowin' my niggas feel it
nothin' is fabricated authentic as i can say it
the only way i play it, this is for curtis davis
mothers of fallen soldiers, children of murdered fathers
fathers out on the corners
corners i'm standing on and i love 'em without a reason
feelin they aid the bleedin' they made me i'm never leavin'
though the looks can look deceiving
believe me yall it might sound sad
but trust me dog it's not all bad
you know they say that no one's perfect
that's why we struggle every day
just know that every single day is a blessing
i'm just tryna find my way
i keep my head above water (keep my head above water)
tell me what's the use of lookin' sad
keep your head above water
cause it ain't all bad
