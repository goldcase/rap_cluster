"in cold blood"
i started small time, dope game, pushin on the corner
twenty cent cook-up, fifty flippers if you want 'em
full of formaldehyde, my clothes wreakin marijuana
cops rollin up on us, my neighborhood's like a sauna
pistol-grippin, insurin won't nobody run up on us
but if they do, fuck 'em, we murderous nickel-dome 'em
i ain't playin no games, i'm on a mission fo' the change
motherfuck bein a lame, i'm ten toes in the game - deep
i can't slip, this whole world want me sleep
see i hustle like a predator and prey on the weak
and playin for keeps, cause see, it's a thin red line
between a nigga gettin his, and me gettin mine
and plus i'm a nigga with that feelin like it's my time
and anybody standin in the way of that is dyin
i bust nine, how many times i gotta warn you?
i ain't the one, be pushin buttons in the sight of my gun
i'm the real live version of the corleone family
so i spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me..
one wrong move, and i'ma have to leave you for the goons
catch you slippin asleep in your bedroom and then (blam)
get you audi, now what the fuck was this dude thinkin?
you can cheat the rules of the streets, and not leave stinkin?
i can squeeze without blinkin, i'm a cold-blooded nigga
bank robber (ooooh) i'm a natural born killer
drug dealer, anything it took to survive
even if it took a nigga to die, i'm a gangsta
i got a brick from a sucker that he wanted to move
but the whole while i'm cookin i'm like, "fuck this dude"
it's on, thirty-six zones of my own
keep the money fo' myself and take the work back home
call that nigga on the phone (ay) i just got knocked
and the cops was askin bout you, come get me hot
never showed, so fuck him and the money that i owed
i got a get rich quick scheme, steppin on the dough
it's cold, but that's it, i'm on it like i want it
and twenty-eight cash and change, the whole game on it
that means i'm on my feet and i can front the homies d
break 'em off a couple of c, and double up they fee
takin over, shoot up they spot, make it hot
and when the cops dry it out, put my work on the block
and if they wanna ride for they corners we ride right with 'em
dummy move, whole thing, the goon squad get 'em
no mo' petty rock hustlin, i'm in for the run
and i'm fo'sho i'm gon' be murdered for this shit that i done
but i'ma die standin up cause i'm a stand up nigga
fuck dyin like a bitch on my knees, i'm a killer
so don't nobody cry cause i was destined to get it
just remember, i'm the one who took the dope game and flipped it
and pimped it, and destroyed everything in the way
of me seein first motherfuckin light of the day
a trigger man, deadly as fuck with a loaded ak
spot my enemy and kill him the american way
i turned a dream into reality, with a fuck you mentality
silencin all these niggaz in the neighborhood who challenged me
family grievin from they loved one's mortality
he ain't got a reason to die then kill hi, it's a tragedy
right?
