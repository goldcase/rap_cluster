"big dogg status (remix)"
(feat. lil wayne, t.i., u.t.p.)
ho! it's young 'face, slanging yay everyday
heavyweight, got a bad bitch in every state
on the grind non-stop till i touch this cake
mark ass niggas stay the fuck up out my way
i'm a true og, you can quote what i say
i'm an h-town nigga from around the way
southside, ridin' dirty like i'm ugk
asshole by nature like my name was trae
and i don't gangbang, i patrol the game
and what i'm representing here is putting holes in brains
before i say the same thing i'll be old and grey
'fore i fall off and rap about my clothes and chains
gripping grain and popping trunks, dog but that ain't me
these elbows hit the scene back in eighty-three
i stay street, when it's done, that's that
you could find me in your hood pumping monster crack
i roll over rodents in rovers with rims on 'em
sniffing out a rat i expose him and then dome him
a lot of nigga's bitches, they claim that they ogs
a straight up pussy and claims that he knows me
you see i, putting out these dvds
now my shit done hit the streets, he gots to squat the pee
got the feds on his team so they watching me
mousetrap for a rat, pussy watch and see
i've been straight {for a long time}
getting cake {for a long time}
e&j {for a long time}
nigga {try to get like this!}
i've been a g {for a long time}
in the street {for a long time}
toting heat {for a long time}
nigga {try to get like this!}
{i got big dog status}
hey i'm they fave
they say fresher to bump bapes, but i ain't scared
it's my pleasure to tell it right, don't think i ain't said
cause they got prices on my head homie, i don't slip
clips long as giraffe necks, that's why i don't trip
just open up and let it rip, ain't nothing new to a g
hey i ain't worried about these niggas till they shooting at me
my partner died, daughter too, give excuses to me
still a buster ass rapper i'm refusing to be
scarface seem to say i'm the king, you a fool if you think
there's another young new rapper dude out there cooler than me (haha)
i choose in the v, brand new with the beat
i live a real life like i say i do in the beat
yo, true indeed, i do indeed
do it for the og's and the true mc's
them busters say this year i got brand new and it's all phat
cut that fighting in the club, i'm done with all that
nigga ass out of line, well his ass getting wet
give a west side nigga ten stacks, that's that
oh, or maybe less as a matter of fact
nigga be testing the professor, what's the matter with cats?
i've been doing this shit, nigga who are you?
lil nigga, i done seen keys bigger than you
lil nigga, you ain't know shit
cut off a nigga head, make him suck his own dick
how the game go? money over bitches and flowers over snitches
money over bitches and flowers over snitches
mr., mr. scarface, pistols into yard fish
mr., mr. scarface, pistols into yard fish
yeah!
i came here to exercise my game
spread love to the hood is how i do my thang
smoking weed with my homies, barbeque them wangs
sip hennesey and coke cause i don't fuck with drank
don't pop pills either cause that shit ain't cool
we just drunk a mad dom 'fore we went to school
flick off, back then i was smashing boys
jump wrong, you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
same rules right now, i demand respect
and if i slapped one hoe, then her man was next
i'm a kick door robber, a hot-shot driver
a crack rock slanging motherfucker for a dollar
if you dare to be laid, then off in the lincoln
but if it ain't no way, then believe i'm finna take it
cause a nigga with no hustle, it ain't worth this g
and a bitch like this is even worse than that
i've been good at bullshitting but this game can cost
and if a nigga can't maintain, mayne he lost
he a nerd, and they fuck nerds in jail i heard
and as a nigga, i come in here with my balls and my word
