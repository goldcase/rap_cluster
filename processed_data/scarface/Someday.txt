"someday"
(feat. faith evans)
i know god is watching from above
sometimes i wonder what i'd do without his love
and although life is full of adversities
i know he's with me, he's with me
i know someday, someday, someday...
someday, someday, someday...
someday, someday, someday
he'll come to get me
i wanna walk with you, follow in your footsteps
talk with you to find out where my good's kept
i been gone away from home for so long
seems like everything i try to do without you go wrong
i'm confused about a lot of things, but not with my fate
so i'm depending on your holy ghost to guide me the way
see i'm a sinner in the 3rd degree
ain't afraid to admit it, scause i seen niggas worse than me
who am i to judge a man when i'm a man myself
in the dark, trying to get me some help
i went from pawn to king, king back to pawn
doing my best to try to ease out the storm
i know that every tunnel's got an end and a light
and i prepared a new beginning in christ
my life is like a jigsaw dulling in time
and as i'm thumbing through this jigsaw puzzle of mine
i know god is watching from above
sometimes i wonder what i'd do without his love
and although life is full of adversities
i know he's with me, he's with me
i know someday, someday, someday...
someday, someday, someday...
someday, someday, someday
he'll come to get me
it seems like every other wednesday i'm attending a wake
but i don't question you, i know that's your way, ok
i know we living for the minute and there's a moment in time
we've got to leave here, cause that's your design
and nothing lasts forever, not even spirit, only your word
that's what i live by, 'cause that's what i heard
i wasn't there when you rose from the dead or parted the sea
i never seen you, but still i believe
how you explain the moon, the sky, the stars and the rain
the sun and the sea, the earth without form facing the deep
in darkness challenging the powers that be
it's impossible for scientists to make up the seas, to make up the trees
so why we turn our backs on the truth?
it's heaven or hell, the point we seem to hide from the youth
and i was singing this morning, got touched by the spirit
so i wrote it down for the homies to hear it
i know god is watching from above
sometimes i wonder what i'd do without his love
and although life is full of adversities
i know he's with me, he's with me
i know someday, someday, someday...
someday, someday, someday...
someday, someday, someday
he'll come to get me
lord i know that i've been wrong
they say a man is lost without a prayer, without a song
so i'm singing on my knees cause i believe you'll keep me strong
until it's time for me to bring it home
but until it's time for me to bring it home
i'll be out in these streets, hanging in the hood
even gangsters need to pray, cause when i pray it's understood
that i got flaws about myself, i can't make it by myself
i need the heaven's help, i want to follow in your foot steps
done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power
and given all his glory to god cause god towers
over all, and in that i save this prayer
for all my homies that's been trapped out there
that's stuck in their ways, it's different now than back in the days
so fuck what they say, cause ain't no coming back from the grave
so when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
then you'll understand what i'm talking about
i know god is watching from above
sometimes i wonder what i'd do without his love
and although life is full of adversities
i know he's with me, he's with me
i know someday, someday, someday...
someday, someday, someday...
someday, someday, someday
he'll come to get me
i know someday, someday, someday...
someday, someday, someday...
someday, someday, someday
he'll come to get me
i just want to be your solider
i just want to be your best soul, woooo lord
