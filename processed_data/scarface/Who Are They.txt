"who are they"
(feat. k-rino, slim thug)
huh
you see a nigga with his game tight, money with a name like
'face (face mob), havin his way, the homie did his thing, right?
you just a peon, the type of bitch i'd pee on
high sidin a nigga, rollin in a neon, now what the fuck was she on?
i'm "prime time" bitch like deion (yeah)
i spinks on a ho like leon
and you are just a castaway, so get your ass away
instead of fuckin you, i'd masturbate
i shouldn't of had to wait, i think you blew your big chance
you rejected when i asked about the eighth grade dance
now i'm big time, like my homeboy randy
plus i'm pushin a porsche with drop top panties
it's just like candy but i ain't hammy
yo ho, so yo, ass can't hand me
shit, fuck your cell phone bitch, you can keep that
broke, you ain't know a motherfucker, where was she at?
i think i remember you, from way back when, but how can i be sure?
that's so long ago and since then we both have grown
but look at you, you're amazin
what's so, crazy, i know how niggaz do
'cause they get money, change and don't remember who they are
listen, in high school with the females, i was rarely selected
i got rejected by the ones the damn nerds rejected
if i wore a shirt monday, this is true, i ain't lyin
by the end of the week you probably saw it two more times
i was discouraged by the microscopic size of my bank
but stayed constantly motivated to rise in the ranks
i used to be a bottom feeder, lowest man on the totem
but i showed a mass like the transit sit on my scrotum
gettin fed by my music and it's all clean work
and the used to be prom queen is a walgreens clerk
i would dream about bein with ya, wantin to kiss on ya
now i let my damn bladder bust before i piss on ya
me and 'face second to none, makin records for fun
you thirty-seven at the strip club gettin naked for ones
but i ain't trippin, you can hit the room with me, it's fine
and when i bust one on her chin, i'm like "clean up on aisle nine!"
(yeah)
i think i remember you, from way back when, but how can i be sure?
that's so long ago and since then we both have grown
but look at you, you're amazin
what's so, crazy, is i know how niggaz do
'cause they get money, change and don't remember who they are
thugga, huh
a (bitch ain't) never been (shit) to me
i've been screamin that since "chronic" popped back in '93
back when i was broke in the hood on my ass
i couldn't get away when the bitch drove past
now a nigga seein cash so fast, things change
same bitch askin for a ride in the range
lookin at a nigga strange, 'cause i ain't tryin to entertain
conversation about her becomin my main
i'm like "bitch, you must of fell and bump your brain
and think you fuckin with a lame, nope not me mayne
i ain't got shit for ya, matter fact, i don't know ya
that's all i'm a show ya, 'cause that's all a nigga owe ya
used to be fine, big titties and behind
had a few kids, now your belly bigger than mine
stomach lookin like you had a fight with a lion
i ain't fuckin with you bitch, move around"
i think i remember you, from way back when, but how can i be sure?
that's so long ago and since then we both have grown
but look at you, you're amazin
what's so, crazy, is i know how niggaz do
'cause they get money, change and don't remember who they are (they are, they are ...)
