"no tears" lyrics
scarface lyrics
"no tears"
now the funeral is over and all the tears are dried up
niggas hangin deep on the cut gettin fired up
lookin for the nigga who pulled his pistol on my homie
an eye for an eye, so now your life is what you owe me
look deep into the eyes of your muthafuckin killer
i want you to witness your muthafuckin murder, nigga
and since you wants to kill, then your ass has got to fry
but ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die
we play the game for keeps and if you slept i guess you sleep
you sho nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep
cause where i come from, yo, everybody's got a gat
and niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
and if your shit is flimsy, then your ass is gonna bend
and like i said before there'll be no tears in the end
i'm rollin through your hood, now my heart is filled with anger
you at your sister's house and now your sister's life in danger
(by a total stranger) with the ?kanga?
niggas wanna bang ya and hang ya
sting ya with one up in the chamber
let's take a trip up holloway
so you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today
we standin up for our own shit
and if you outside the click, then you die, bitch
it ain't no love in this muthafucka
it ain't no love for yourself or your other brother
because we real with this shit, so we stay true
and since we bang, we do what o.g.'s say do
i've got the mind of the man in the mirror
so i'm lookin at me vaguely
but i can't seem to fade me
i've got my pistol pon cock
ready to lick shots non-stop
until i see your monkey-ass drop
and let your homies know who done it
cause when it comes to this gangsta shit
you muthafuckas know who run it
so when you put this muthafucka to the test
you gotta realize somethin, nigga: (you fuckin with the very best)
i've got this killer up inside of me
i can't talk to my mother, so i talk to my diary
i'm goin off on the deep end
i find myself face to face with myself while i'm sleepin
i see your picture in my head and my hand shake
you can run, you can hide, but there's no escape
my inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
i got to get this muthafucka before he gets to me
so in your own blood you'll bathe
and i won't stop until i put this muthafucka in his fuckin grave
and i can say this once again
you can cry but you'll still die, there'll be no tears in the end
