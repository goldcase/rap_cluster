"untouchable" lyrics
scarface lyrics
"untouchable"
its on and once again i come to you wit rough shit
game to bust shit when mutha fuckers wanna fuck wit
the mastermind will bring it once i seen it in light
awaken by the sounds of niggas screamin' at night
cover your eyes i leave you face to face with your maker
the time taker intend your mind so now i break ya
no runnin' from it you should've ran before i done it
cause now i got this loaded twelve gage against your stomach
you scarred for life and your whole high life's invited
burned alive its all for real so tonight i ignite
and leave you all face down to die
with no will to live i can see the fear in your eyes
no warning surprise nigga i come for taking
your soul for satan watching' every move that your making
your sure mistaken if you a ho before i turn out
walking away i'll heat you up and leave you burnt out-nigga
i'm hard to kill cause i refuse to die
and can't no man born of woman alive kill me
i'm untouchable
un-touch a-ble out here baby
(i'm untouchable)
un-touch a-ble out here baby
(i'm unfuckable)
un-touch a-ble out here baby
un-touch a-ble out here baby
it's danger i'm standin' in the footsteps of danger
wit a loaded mac 11 stripped wit rips in the chamber
the anger i aim the barrel of the hanger
deep into the mind of this mutha fuckin stranger
i change ya outlook on living and i leave ya
frozen starin' into space shakin' seizuring
i told ya the southside niggas roll deep
i showed ya the northside niggas don't sleep
ya beat i'm coming down shootin up your section
you are now witnessing the gangster shit pure perfection
i'm old school o.g. niggas know me
from slanging' eightballs uncooked to moving whole keys
now why these niggas wanna test my skills
i'm a killa and i chastise steel
to mix and mingle with this millionaire status
and send a mutha fucker to hell when he fuck with brad-it's
the killer instinct that never left me
the southside still true to the game little lefty is back
wit shit that mutha fuckers can't fade
rhyming but still you mutha fuckers aint paid
so how can one try to see the unseen
before you step your ass to the square know one thing
it's closed curtain we leavin' mutha fuckers hurtin'
it's rap-a-lot mafia life we all workin'
punk we shut you down before you get it started
you can hate it but i'm goin' get mines and that's regardless- bitch
i got these niggas boo-hooin' like hoes
jealous of the game i obtain and i chose
to exercise to the best of my ability
it aint no mutha fuckin' kill me
i'm untouchable
un-touch a-ble out here baby
(i'm untouchable)
un-touch a-ble out here baby
un-touch a-ble out here baby
(unfuckable)
un-touch a-ble out here baby
