"cocaine" lyrics
scarface lyrics
"cocaine"
if you want to go out
you've got to take her out, cocaine
and if you want to get down
down on the ground, cocaine
she don't lie
she don't lie
she don't lie, cocaine
well if you've had bad news
you want to kick your blues, cocaine
and if your day is done
but you just got to run on, cocaine
she don't lie
she don't lie
she don't lie, cocaine
feeling is gone but you just
got to ride on, cocaine
but don't forget this fact
you just can't get it back, cocaine
she don't lie
she don't lie
she don't lie, cocaine
she don't lie
she don't lie
she don't lie, cocaine
