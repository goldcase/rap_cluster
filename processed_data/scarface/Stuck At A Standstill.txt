"stuck at a standstill"
these niggas is fuckin with a dangerous game
hey joe, what's up baby?
yeah, i like the beat
hahaha...
hey, when you drop drums i'ma drop rhymes, aight?
(drop rhymes)
nah, i don't need no count-off
just drop the beat and i'm on it, aight?
(2-3-4)
i took my chances when i did my dirt
and my advice to any nigga if you crimin, you do it worse
just get enough and step the fuck back
cause in this game when you get fame
you gotta start dumpin these agents off your nutsack
i'm just a nigga out the hood tryin to have things
but when i got up on my feet you're screamin "brad changed!"
and your excuse was that the money came
but my excuse was that you missed the plane, simple and plain
i got to show my homies love, though
i just don't fuck around with niggas that i don't know
and you can take that how you wanna take it
i'm from these muthafuckin streets
and the same rules apply in this game, don't ever break it
ain't my muthafuckin luck i'm all alone at the crack
and you niggas don't wanna try to attack
we steady dyin over dumb shit, and me, i'm steady losin my sleep
cause niggas ain't familiar with the rules of the streets
you're stuck
stuck at a standstill
on the beat one time, come on
it don't stop
give it to em
...3
and to my niggas on the streets crimin (watch for haters)
stop sittin on the sidelines and (get your paper)
too many niggas complainin pointin fingers at the problems
"that's why i hate my baby mama"
i'm just a nigga from the very bottom
skippin classes, goin 8 balls or the white powder
tryin to get it while the muthafuckin gettin good
the possibilities of movin out my neighborhood
don't get me wrong, i had them dreams too
but the only thing you do is get your cream, fool
get your muthafuckin green, fool
niggas ain't knowin 'bout the ins and the outs
first get in, then you get out
don't be stuck at a standstill
(you know...
to the 2, ah 2-1
(...i was thinkin)
rock the mob shit for niggas, come on y'all
(...need to, i don't know, maybe findin new hustles
like niggas is runnin out of hustles, you know?)
when it's over don't nobody cry
just enjoy it while you live life cause everybody gotta die
so when you see me i'll be hella high
bendin corners with my top down checkin out the changes in the sky
shootin paper clips at jupiter
the mo' i learn it's like i'm gettin stupider, and stupider
tryin to make the best out of a fucked up decision
i'm just a nigga with a vision, which is
gettin up, gettin out, gettin my profits
tryin to stay away from these bitches that jock dick
movin up to move on, gotta stay true to it
that's just the way you gotta do it
and these niggas here is renegades, don't give a fuck
but if you're real, then you like it rough, nigga what?
you know it, you know what i'm sayin is real
now step the fuck off all those standstills
cause you're stuck
stuck at a standstill
stuck
to the beat one time
yeah
my nigga mike dean
