"all night long"
(feat. f.l.a.j.)
well it was raining all day long
the night before we fought and saturday
was gone and it was raining
all day long
i thought last night would never end
now saturday is cold and damp and
i left you all alone, i didn't talk at all
you felt it all
the way that i got no more to say
and the rest of you can say its right
but i don't trust a thing in sight
when everything is overrated,
you're so good you just can't fake it
i waited for some kind of answer,
some kind words so that i can cold ya
i left you all alone
i didn't talk at all and now i feel so sad
i guess i just needed a day to feel lonely
lonely and blue.
oh, how about you?
well it was raining all day long
well it was raining all day long
well it was raining all day long
well it was raining all day long
punk rock millionaires with coke up their nose
writing records in designer homes
but the rains kinda nice
and it's really all right if we don't talk at all
it's only one song!
