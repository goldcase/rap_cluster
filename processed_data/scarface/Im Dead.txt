"i'm dead" lyrics
scarface lyrics
"i'm dead"
i woke up to a tune on the radio, check it
an old church hymn behind a breakbeat record (yeahhh)
sounded kinda funky so i pumped it, right
but rudely interrupted by a neighborhood street fight
when will you motherfuckers quit?
every motherfuckin mornin it's the same ol bullshit
i peeped to see the thrashin
some nigga runnin with a butcher knife, screamin out "assassin!"
he ran by a friend of mine, it bugged him
his eyes showed fear, that's the reason why he stuck him
anyway, that's how i seen it
you rarely see a nigga kill another nigga,
and he doesn't mean it
so that's the way i took it
anyway the boy is dead, no matter how you look at it
and life goes on..
i was feelin kinda funny - aiyyo something's wrong
i went to take a shower duke
bumped into the wall and i smooth went through
now i'm thinkin i'm in trouble
i reached to touch my face, but i couldn't feel my beard stubble
i screamed, "oh lord help!"
looked into the mirror and i couldn't see myself
i called up my mom's house
and realized somethin was wrong, no doubt
she picked up, said "hello" in a low tone
i said, "hey ma!" and she hung up the telephone
sick and lookin weary
my cousin walks in, i said, "what's up?" but he didn't hear me
started packin up my shit g
looked at a picture of me, put it down and said, "rest in peace"
realizin what he said man
i can't talk, i don't exist, i'm a dead man
yeah i guess i'm dead right?
i'm goin to the cemetary to peep out action's gravesite
and sure enough, there it is
my mom and girl talkin, holdin on to brad's kids
i look into the box g
son of a bitch!  i don't believe it, that's me!
momma kissed me on my head
aww shit.. i'm dead (i'm dead)
