"big dogg status"
young face slangin, ya ya ya
heavyweight, got a bad bitch in every state
on the grind, nonstop till i touch this cake
mark ass niggas, stay the fuck up out my way
i be true o.g., you can quote what i say
i'm a h-town nigga from around the way
southside, ridin' dirty like i'm ugk
asshole by nature like my name was tre
and i don't gangbang, i control the game
what i'm representin' here's puttin' holes in brains
oh, i say the same thing till i'm old and grey
for i falloff and rap about my clothes and chains
grippin' grain and poppin' trunks, dawg that ain't me
these elbows hit the scene back in '83
i stay street with it, dun asked that
you can find me in your hood pumpin' monster crack
i rollover rodents with rims on em
sniffing out a rat, i expose them and then bend on em
i lotta bitches but they claiming they o.g.s
a straight up pussy, he claims he knows me
see i puttin out these vvdees
let my shit hit the streets, he got to squat to pee
got them eggs on these beams, so they watchin' me
might trap for a rat, pussy watch and see
i been straight for a long time
gettin' checks for a long time
gettin' jake for a long time
e&j for a long time
nigga, try to get like me
been a g, for a long time
been in the streets, for a long time
toting heat, for a long time
nigga, try to get like me
i got big dogg status, i got big dogg status
i got big dogg status, i got big dogg status
i got big dogg status, i got big dogg status
i got big dogg status, i got big dogg status
i came here to exercise my game
swear love to the hood
that's how i do my thang
smoke weed with my hommies
bar-b-q them wangs
sip hennisy and coke
see i don't fuck with drank
hold out bill ski
because that shit aint cool
we just drunk a mad dog before we went to school
way up back then i was smashing boys
jump wrong you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
same shit right now
i demand respect
and if i slap one hoe than a man was next
i'm kick door robber
a hot shot driver
a crack rock slanging mother fucker for a dollar
if there's shit there to be made
then i'm finna make it
but if ther ain't no way
than i'm believe take it
cause a nigga with no hustle is his worth is (gay?)
and a bitch like this is even worse then that
i'm a fool bullshiting what this game can cost
and if a nigga cant maintain than man he's lost
being heard and they fuck nerds in jail i heard
and as a nigga i come in here with my balls word
i been straight for a long time
gettin' checks for a long time
gettin' jake for a long time
e&j for a long time
nigga, try to get like me
been a g, for a long time
been in the streets, for a long time
toting heat, for a long time
nigga, try to get like me
i got big dogg status, i got big dogg status
i got big dogg status, i got big dogg status
i got big dogg status, i got big dogg status
i got big dogg status, i got big dogg status
man on second thought the story is about boys
running round talking bout how they ride these cars
i was sitting in these benz at the age of 19
when i was 21 i had a yellow ferrari
22 i was portioned with a top at back
23 in a rose with the pipe to match
24 i wasn't tripping what i came up in
i was focussing on how to be like james back then
wonder how respected was the life i chose
being famous wasn't nothing i just liked my dough
i was living in the fast lane
man for sho
short temper quick to up let this thing unload
so if i had a problem with ya
use a blanket no
shaw the message then you see the nigga's brain exploads
so if you see a nigga chunk da doose as you see me ride by
i been straight for a long time
gettin' checks for a long time
gettin' jake for a long time
e&j for a long time
nigga, try to get like me
been a g, for a long time
been in the streets, for a long time
toting heat, for a long time
nigga, try to get like me
i got big dogg status, i got big dogg status
i got big dogg status, i got big dogg status
i got big dogg status, i got big dogg status
i got big dogg status, i got big dogg status
