"mickey slipper (interlude)"
ready?
no.
oh!
puppy, power!
okay, hello!
watch your drin.. what?  watch your drink!
no no.. i think i'm too late, am i too late?
hit it!
i'm coolin in the sun, on a beach in the cabana
sippin on some vodka in a glass with tropicana
i'm chillin and i'm chompin on a turkey shish-ka-bob
too far from work to hear the phone ring at the job
men in bikinis, g-strings should i say
waitin for the daddy-long-one to come my way
here he comes now, i feel i start to sweat
blunder but i wonder just how wet will i get
he offers me his hand, of course you know i take it
until he tells me that he wants to swim a little naked
my eyes are bulgin, i black out, damn it's black as tar
woke up i don't know when, sittin at the bar
i know it's hard to follow, the story's kinda tricky
what i didn't know was somebody slipped a mickey
into my drink, which caused a fantasy
and somehow slapped me back into reality!
wish i had another mickey i'd go back for a quickie
find the daddy-long-one that was surely tryin to get me
this just goes to show, you must stop and think
when you're out partyin, never leave your drink..
word!
