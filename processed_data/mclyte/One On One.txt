"one on one"
yeah, yeah, ooh
smooth better that i ever seen him look
as i flip the vibe book
he's on the front page, never looking his age
he's all that and i'm all in so let the games begin
now i'ma give you something' so you could get into it
i got the side view so i could watch ya do it
you've been on my mind but you're so hard to find
holly woods got a hold on that behind
i ain't ashamed to play the game
listen here, i won't say no names
put your ass out, make your woman put your ass out
if you knew i was talking to you, you would pass out
'cause i gave you no type of indication
and if i did i was probably on some medication
i got the hots for your daddy and i just begun
let's do this one on one
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(yeah, i wanna play that game)
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(you and me, baby, one on one)
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(yeah, i wanna play that game)
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(just you and me, baby, one on one)
half way across the world i seen you at my show
with your girl back in italy, but are you still into me?
'cause if you are i'm here to let you know
you don't have to be a superstar for me and you to go find
now i ain't never lied you got the body of an angel
bangle, bangle, watch the bojangle from every angle
i'm clocking you, honey
we could sign a prenup, i got my own money
i just wanna get to know you a little better
in the lyte after dark on the dl whatever
i wanna feel your muscle flex off your backbone
i got the jones and i can't leave you alone
i wanna rub your deltoid down to your bicep
better late than never and i'm sorry i slept
but now i'm well awake and i'm ready for the fun
let's do this one on one
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(i wanna play that game)
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(you and me, baby, one on one)
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(yeah, i wanna play that game)
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(just you and me, baby, one on one)
damn, the only brother make me look twice
believe that baby, i wanna sacrifice
i'm on it, you couldn't shake me off if you tried
no sleeping on the job and i'm wide eyed
i like the video you got out, the song is butter
try to keep a clean head and my mind out the gutter
but it's hard, you bring out the best and the worst
if i knew you way back when i would have let you hit it first
love, it's like water on the brain
only you can tame this run away train
last time i seen ya, gleam in your eye
you was looking fly with your girl by your side
shit, i ain't trying to take her place
i just wanna have your face all up in my space
i got the hots for ya and i just begun
you and me, baby, one on one
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(yeah, i wanna play that game)
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(you and me, baby, one on one)
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(yeah, i wanna play that game)
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(just you and me, baby, one on one)
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(one on one, i wanna play that game, yeah)
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
(you and me, baby)
one, one, one, one
one, one, one, one
