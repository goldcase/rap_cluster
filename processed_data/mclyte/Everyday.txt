"everyday"
every day i need my shit done in a special way everyday
off the top see me and want to serve
just thinkin about what they need
ain't that some nerve, now look here 24 hours and
7 whole days, i demand my respect
i demand my praise, everyday that i wake
i gotta have everything done with no mistakes
i take it incredibly slow don't try to rush me
no means no, i never said a no that meant yes
other women get taken for granted
i guess i got a wish list that must be fulfilled
and you gets none until i get my toes sucked
and my eyebrows pluked
i need my car waxed and floor shellac
i need my back rubbed and da bubbled in the tub
that float to the bed so that we can make love
every day i need my shit done in a special way everyday
every day i need my shit done in a special way everyday
it ain't to ask for when
i come off tour to have my truck washed
or my body massaged, all the bills paid i send home
all my dough and you being my man it just ain't for show
all the lovey dovey yeah that is sweet
but honey bunny yeah gotta earn your keep
but don't sleep cause i need a lot done
and cold harded yeah check out whatever is clever
and get to stepping if you know something better
if not then respect whatcha got
meanwhile i got a new tide at the lot
pick it up and bring it back to the spot
this is how we do it this is how we do it everyday
i need it done in a special way baby, tell them how it goes
every day i need my shit done in a special way everyday
every day i need my shit done in a special way everyday
on the real i need an man that understands me and
realizes the reality. i'm in the m.c. industry which
means i want to live lovely i gotta make money
listen so never ask me to give it less then what i got
if it's too hot then raise up out my spot
if it's my trade i made up the black ace of spade
alone in the world it's me ya can't fade
it's my life, i do it my way
you don't like my way, hit the highway
see i'm special not because i'm mc lyte, but because
i'm a women with the gift to bear life, it's done
yes i've rested my case now run pick up my dermalogica
for my face this is how it goes down everyday
i need it done in a special way baby
every day i need my shit done in a special way everyday
every day i need my shit done in a special way everyday
