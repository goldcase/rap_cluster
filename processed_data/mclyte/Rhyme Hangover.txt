"rhyme hangover" lyrics
mc lyte lyrics
"rhyme hangover"
you've heard the hard side, the rough tough side
now it's time to hop aboard for a pleasure ride
and yo, i suggest you don't resist
this voyage, you don't wanna miss this
it makes you woozy and feel kinda dizzy
fantasies wild and imagination busy
why would you want it?
go ahead spin the rude moves around
if it's faint you feel, then you oughta sit down
and let the beat just seep through the cracks
and crannies of your brain - you can't remember your name
the beat'll tip-tap and takin over your mind
a cure for this hangover, i doubt you can find
so seek if you wanna, cuz imagine your position
if they say there's a potion well then they're probably competition
lyte has no fear because it overcomes evil
my plan stands strong, not a one is feeble
with no hesitation here's the incantation
why would you want it?
open up your ears and rev up your gears
this is mc lyte's train, not ol' steps and stairs
and like i said, i knew you couldn't hack it
so i'll pull out the stretcher and the white straightjacket
you can talk to the fly, for more than a night
but when they ask who put you here, you tell 'em
mc lyte - crumbs!
why would you want it?
why would you need it?
why would you want it?
