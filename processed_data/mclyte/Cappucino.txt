"cappucino"
it was a café
it was a café on the westside
it was a café on
it was a café on the westside, midtown
it was a café on the westside, midtown
said they had the best cap of cappucino around
so i stepped in, and i ordered a cup
someone grabbed me by my throat and said, "shut the fuck up!"
and i did, pronto, quick fast
how much longer would the torture last?
in the wrong place, at the wrong time
it was a drug sale, i could feel from behind
death, it was gettin closer, right behind my back
ready to attack
i got shot in a shoot-out, and then i died
i could feel it, i was on the other side
in between lives, i'm so confused
what do i do, oh, what do i do?
but was it really time for me to go?
why, oh why did i need cappucino?
why, oh why?
why, oh why did i need cappucino?
why, oh why?
why, oh why did i need cappucino?
why, oh why did i need cappucino?
but then i calmed down, i spotted some friends
that i knew in a past life, way back when
a couple had died in a drug world
and this one guy died fightin over his girl
another died drivin while intoxicated
why do people make livin so complicated?
but then i saw a girl, her name was mary
introduced to drugs by her boyfriend harry
he sold crack to the kids on the uptown corners
a social worker named hannah smith tried to warn her
but she wouldn't listen, no one listens
i saw the light, i awakened, it was a dream
man oh man, you shoulda heard me scream
so glad to be given - my life back
so good to be livin - or is dead better?
i didn't have to run from the bullets or drugs
and i didn't have to run from the murderers or thugs
i didn't have to worry about fallin from a plane
but at this café was death still callin my name?
or did this café even exist?
and was my name just another on the death list?
i knew it couldn't happen, even though
on the bottom of my shirt was a spot of cappucino...
cappucino
cappucino
bust it, to some of you that really don't know
i break it down to you, the word 'cappucino'
it's somewhat like coffee, then again not quite
it's creamy and smooth, and it goes down light
they charge you 3 dollars, you ask is it worth it?
but when you start drinkin... shit, it'd be workin
i'm hooked, well, i was, cause, yo, it's the best
but if everytime i drink i voyage through death
i leave it alone and just stick to tea
cappucino was fly, but too fly for me
why, oh why did i need cappucino?
cappucino
why, oh why did i need cappucino?
cappucino
why, oh why?
why, oh why?
why, oh why did i need cappucino?
cappucino
cappucino
cappucino
cappucino
it was a café on the westside
it was a café on the west...
it was a café on the westside
it was a café on the west...
cappucino
