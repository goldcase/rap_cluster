"please understand" lyrics
mc lyte lyrics
"please understand"
i just want you to understand
i just want you to understand
- understand what?
i met a guy named tommy, damn, he charmed me
met him at the mall, but i knew he wouldn't harm me
we exchanged numbers, hopin to meet again
we couldn't wait for the romance to begin
the relationship grew strong
i didn't wanna be right if this love was wrong
but oh no, came the problems, the first segment
the dumb kid went and got some girl pregnant
the second segment: started wheelin and dealin
didn't give a damn about how lyte was feelin
but then he got wise, started treatin me better
cause all of his friends said i was a go-getter
he knew he was usin me, and abusin me
he also knew that soon he'd be losin me
first i clocked him, yeah, i docked him
but i rocked him - and then i dropped him
then there was dave, couldn't behave
so i punished him and put him in my lyte-as-a-rock cave
then he got bold, tried to play insane
so bigfoot threw him off my paperthin train
he tried to 10%-dis me, but he pissed me off
cause i'm the boss, and you know i'm not havin it
lyte is too dope, and you know i ain't crabbin it
then there was henry, way too friendly
i needed a trip, he said he would send me
pay my airfare, if he could come with me
i said, "listen, honey, i don't need your money
believe me when i tell you, i've got my own
cause i'm mc lyte on the microphone"
yeah
here's another story: a dude named corey
when i used to work, yes, i was a clerk
at the worldtrade center, back in high school
this little player musta thought i was a fool
he took me out to lunch, offered me a ride home
when we got there, he asked could he use my telephone
i said, "yeah, sure", flipped him to the floor
cause he said "what's up?" and tried to feel my butt
i kicked him down the stairs and said, "what you're provin?"
rolled him to his car and said, "get movin!"
he tried to score it, i wasn't goin for it
you can't play me, i'm lyte thee mc
never saw his face again until last week
all beat up and bleedin down the street
i looked to my left, there was a girl with a pipe in her hand
sayin, "why oh why can't you understand?"
