mc lyte lyrics
"slave 2 the rhythm"
why is it that your watch stopped tickin, but you still keep clockin?
and no matter how hard you jinx, i keep rockin
listen, hoe, cause i'm the lyte one
and if you're lookin for a fight, you found the right one
(they call me lyte)
(and i'm a slave to the rhythm)
(funky fresh, dressed to impress, ready to party)
i'm not a procrastinator, or a instigator
but when it comes to dope rhymes on the mic, i'm the creator
i never look for trouble, but somehow it finds me
but yo, i just conquer it, and leave it all behind me
the l-y-t-e, very outspoken
and when i rock a rhyme, sometimes i leave you chokin
i'm mc lyte, comin live and direct
i never lose a battle, cause i always come correct
in any case i win, again and again
you see lyte is at the top till the very end
and even though i may be short, believe, i don't take none
try your luck and we'll see who will get done
i mean immediately, like quick fast
don't turn your back, cause this mic'll be in your ass
and don't take what i say too lightly
i beat you, defeat you so quietly
sneak up and hit you like a fuckin tornado
cause in the rap field lyte's the fuckin a/k/a doe
the capital l, the y to the e
shit, give me room and i'll slay an mc
whether it's in a crowd, or on the sneak tip
i wax you and your posse watch you trip and flip
as you drop the mic, cause you don't have the gift
to rip a style, fast or slow
(why, lyte?) too busy hoein it, sniffin up blow
don't get mad, it's just a talent i was given
what i'm sayin, i'm a slave to the rhythm
bein that i'm dissin, i was reminiscin
you was at my show, yo, you was on a mission
(yo, what you tellin me, lyte?) she was ass-kissin
no show, you hoe, no work, you jerk
(cool, lyte, i think her feelings are hurt)
alright, i'll chill and i'll come to my senses
but next time you diss, think of the consequences
yo, i am no joke, i'm sharp like barbwire
try to touch me, yo, you're bound to catch a fire
i never lose my cool, but if i do, yo, you're lost
i be forced to show and prove exactly who's the boss
who gets the income - and then some
i don't diss you for the money, i diss you for the fun
don't get mad, it's just a talent i was given
what i'm sayin, i'm a slave to the rhythm
it took a whole album for you to try and diss me
and ha-ha-ha, slum bitch, you still missed me
but yo, i'm off the dissin tip, cause that takes no creation
i'm into other things that bring me commodation
so i rap about funny things, or issues that are serious
sometimes i rap a topic that leave my people curious
and other times i diss to put one in their place
if i diss you on wax, then i will diss you to your face
some say i'm foul, and they don't like the way i'm livin
but yo, ask me if i care...
i'm just a slave, i'm just a slave, i'm just a slave
to the goddamn rhythm
(they call me lyte)
(and i'm a slave to the rhythm)
(funky fresh, dressed to impress, ready to party)
'gangstress', don't make me laugh
ha-ha-ha
and keep your eyes on this
and keep your eyes on this
(they call me lyte)
(and i'm a slave to the rhythm)
(funky fresh, dressed to impress, ready to party)
