"fire" lyrics
mc lyte lyrics
"fire"
(feat. neb luv)
yeah, i heard somebody say fire
y'all want heat, here go heat, right here
lyte the mc, neb luv, show them what heat's got
yeah, we spittin' venom in 'em, whether it's men or women
i kill 'em like the  and dismiss 'em at the minimum
i'm leavin' 'em twisted like a braid, glow like a fade
my lyric cut your spirit like a swiss army switchblade
the more in my cup, the more dangerous
more that i bust, they call me angel dust
i'm heat proof, flip a nigga off their feet
then creep the streets and  underneath
the skin off the bone, how i burn a mc
stop, look and listen, and learn from me
i got that fi-i-i-ire, get lost and pay the cost
get tossed, that's your only option
you're locked in cause i'm blockin' your oxygen
i'm knockin' your chin, rockin' your noggin
i'm rollin' with foxx and them
bitches better quit before lyte hit, fuck what you thought
niggas gettin' caught
heat scorchin', torchin'
set it off, let it blow often, better use caution
fi-i-i-ire, get you up in the club and get the drinks tossin'
yo, fuck
heat scorchin', torchin'
set it off, let it blow often, better use caution
fi-i-i-ire, get you up in the club and get the drinks tossin'
yo, fuck
i breathe through, bleed through
the track, you suckers are see-through
react with a mack, you're fake, i could read through
like buck, youse a soft crook
but look twisted and catch your heart hook
the street, plus my niggas gotta eat like kings
this chick carry heat supreme
sinister, make you a believer
conniving industry cats be lying, spying
on the sick chick, with them sick hits
no, here's a sick tip, keep this your business
music addictive,  voice
layin' the cuts in the royce five four
flow like c4 through your door
hit ya open like pores, bang baby get you on the floor
you know how it is when you move till your sore
nothing but the bubbly, ain't nobody poor
burnin' mc's at 99.9 degrees
with flows like these i keep 'em on they knees
torturin', they sit motionless
after they feel the dust they can't get with us
i'm razor sharp, comin' for your main artery
it ain't hard for me, it ain't hard to see this
fi-i-i-ire
blaze like inferno, injure internal
damn right, neb and lyte crew will hurt you
suffocate the body like heat wave we'll work you
till you're purple, till you feel the pain
i'm a shine, keep it live, baby feel the flame
from top to bottom, cut 'em, gutter, we got 'em
do 'em like the  leave the rest for rock and i swear
it ain't no calm for us in here, we got the fi-i-i-ire nigga
