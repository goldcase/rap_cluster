"another dope intro (interlude)"
yo who is it?
yo lyte it's epic, you got time to chill?
nah umm, sorry i ain't got no time to chill
but i got umm..
skins, skins, every now and then
i meet a peter with a pecker that tries to be in
because my tongue is the mind of a readywriter
like chuck d said, i'm a rhyme fighter
no there is no other, because i'm smooth like butter
or should i say parkay, butter - parkay
butter - parkay, fuck it anyway
yo, you get the rhythm (what the rhythm?) that i'm promotin
and if not, i say it in slow motion
l.... y.... yeah.... t.... e....
uhh! ("there it is")
