mc lyte lyrics
"mc lyte likes swingin'"
i may come on strong but that's what you like
you like a female mc who can handle the mike
how do i know? because you told me so
you instantly prefer a pro to supervise the show
so that's why i'm here, don't mean to make a case of it
this rap here, well, it's just for the taste of it
i write the rap to make the whole world sing
and i'm the type of female, well, i like to swing
mc lyte likes swingin
party people in the place, since you started the case
of a demonstration, i need concentration
so you can make a full examination
then you will agree that i'm the best mc
and so is my deejay on the tables, rock
this is the best jam that you could get
the rap by lyte and the beat by stetsa
(beat by stetsa) (beat by stetsa)
never turn it down, cause it's what you requested
any mike i hold, you know the big man pressed it
sole believer in the rap i say
you believe it too, that's why you never walk away
you like the way i do it, you like my style
study me like a book, cause you know i'm worth your while
expressions on my face show you just how i feel
add a rap to my gestures, now you know the deal
mc lyte likes swingin
cause yo, i am the best and that i'll boast
sit down and be the guest, and i'll be the host
it's wack to those that know and those that do not
like 'coke is it' i hit the spot
like 'good vibrations', i'm like sunkist
the rap is smooth, cause it's sealed with chapstick
not gonna say that i been rappin since the day of birth
but i've acquired the knowledge like ms. butterworth
ask me what's important, i tell you time and effort
ask me how i do it, it's lyte's  method
yeah, lyte is good, bud lite's good for ya
i'm exciting just like toyota
