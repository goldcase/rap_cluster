"keep it movin'"
(feat. payne)
yeah, hmm-huh
hmm-huh, yeah
yeah
she's arrived, miss hotness
all up in the limo, yeah me and my partners
got a lot of dough like it's supposed to be
they smell it and they want to come close to me
they see me at the club try approaching me
sending notes to me, want to toast to me
stop, i got a lot of history
that you need to know before you start kissing me
i'm a libra and if you tip my scales
you'll be riding on the third rail ready to bail, shhhh
i give them hell when they copy my sounds
trying to rock me â€˜round when they be knocking me downtown
quick to bed, want to know what i said
off the top of the head cause i'm living on the edge
ain't that rough now you know what's up
it's the ride of your life, now buckle up, come on
you got to be special to get down with me
if you're not (if you're not)
keep it movin' (keep it movin')
all the negativity don't bring that to me
if you are (if you are)
keep it movin' (keep it movin')
ain't no mediocre here, you're dealing with the top
when you're coming for my spot, i'm as light as a rock
when you enter my world, well bring the whole house down
i'm the chosen girl with the golden sound
i'm feisty, ain't nobody as nice as me
precisely, killing them all softly when they shiesty
got crazy ways to stay crazy paid
so all lazy days my seeds don't fade away
i got rhymes that be late for those that want to play
rhymes on lay-way for those who can't pay
i switch mode wild west episode, overload
everybody wants to know a horse like rowe
gitty up, put your money where your tongue rest
is it jane west or loveless
i guess it will be the last man on the street
holding the heat, standing in middle of the street, come on
keep it on them
case closed, everyone knows
i'm the best at what i do
so you better never doze
i rock your bulge and those mc's
that any track no room to breath
ain't no replacing me, stop chasing me
not knowing how to act when you're facing me
oh you wanna roll with me, ride shotgun
look hun do you got more to drop some
can't hustle with the hustler
bout to go up in your mouth
get your jugular, i strategize and lock them in
box them in so tight they need oxygen
ooh please you're not next to me
baby icons keeping you guessing b
if you've never been impressed by me
just mess with me, that's the recipe
to get blessed from me
all that right there
(keep it movin')
for all you non-believers
(keep it movin')
if you not on my level
(keep it movin')
i ain't got time for that there
(keep it movin')
if you're not nice with yours
(keep it movin')
talking that yang put it on pause
(keep it movin')
if you not about them papers
(keep it movin')
you catch up with me lataz
(keep it movin')
keep it movin'
