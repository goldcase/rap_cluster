"woo woo (party time)"
(feat. nicci gillbert)
uh, yeah
uh, yeah
naughty but you like and nasty but you want it
i'm the chick that never front it
picture that
me wearin a pager
so you can be down my back
it ain't happin jack
am i too fine?
if so i can leave
have somewhere to go
you better believe
i keep a tight schedule
not many are blessed
still on a quest
not knowin i'm da best
causin a mess wherever i go
they still want me there i'm the star of the show
your ride is sweet
my ride is much sweeter
come take a ride with this senorita
theres more to me that the eye can't see
but i'm twice as much as you'd thought i'd be
when i hit da scene
all better be where cause da party don't jump till i get there
come on
we're doin it everyday
all night is how we like to play
feel the rhythm do what you want to do
kick back we're doin it at the woooooo
you took to long to ask
now i don't know
if you can hang wit my flow
keep it on da dlow i start da fire
watch it go down
when it's time to put the flame out
i put the juice down
when you woo-woo
so nasty it's sick wanna know my tricks
studyin' me like a flick
i'm the girl your mama warned you about at night
ask ronnie, bobby, ricky and mike
i'm that candy girl
i got da suga for your sweet toothe
comin in your crib in my birthday suit
i'm that, bad habit you just can't shake
what i want i take
some a y'all could relate
got the yab yum
to get ya stuck like glue
it ain't over to we all come through
when i hit the scene
all better be where cause da party don't jump til i get there
so you wanna be da tiger roaming through my woods huh
babe boy you gotta bring da goods
not just any penny
can get in my piggy
bently or empty you just can't tip me
lyte got, just what you like
all up in your ear but i'm not like mike
red hot
be the brown chili peppa
y'all know my words
let's sing it together
light to infinite
like dusk til dawn
when i hit da scene
all better beware cause da party don't ump da jump til i get there
