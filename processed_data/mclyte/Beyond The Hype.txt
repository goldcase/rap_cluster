mc lyte lyrics
"beyond the hype"
i, am, back on the scene
i'm takin it to the extremes
new blend, i've been schemin
raw type stuff i know you've been fiendin
waitin for, such a long time
for mc lyte to drop another dope rhyme
well i deliver as quick as you call my name
i'm beyond the hype, beyond the fame
so now, i prove to you
that i can shake you groove you and move you too
i am, too much to bear
to touch and then share
once you've had one taste one touch one bite
all you want is m-c lyte!
and i deliver as quick as you call my name
i'm beyond the hype, beyond the fame
we've got to try to move beyond
i'm comin
we've got to try to break on through
to the extreme
we've got to try to move beyond
beyond the hype
we've got to try to break on through!
can't, you, see, i'm beyond the hype
and all that type of jazz and pizazz
i'm, into, reality
forget the fantasy, this is me
beyond the hype, so don't believe
what you read, cause they'll deceive
so now i come to you
telling no lies, the truth is in my eyes
unlike the broadcasters on the news
who try to tell you, the don'ts and the do's
the media blows things out of proportion
the public's eye, proceed with caution
it's a dog eat dog world
but we'll be alright
all we gots to do is stick together
and move beyond the hype
you, must, trust when i say i'm here to stay
and believe i'll never leave
haste, makes, waste
the track is all that, so pick up the pace
forget the rumors, gossip, shit-talk
besides that's old news, and that can walk
i'm beyond that, you are also
release the negative vibe and let it go
so now, i come to you
bearing gifts that certainly uplift
from coast to coast, midwest i'm the most
but still, not on a high post
i'm comin, just call my name
beyond the hype, beyond the fame
down to earth, i'm just that type
to take you and move beyond the hype
i'm comin
to the extreme
beyond the hype
beyond the hype...
