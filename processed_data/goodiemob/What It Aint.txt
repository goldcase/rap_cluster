"what it ain't" lyrics
goodie mob lyrics
"what it ain't"
now tlc will challenge goodie mob
to a game of ghetto laser tag
when they say 'what it is'
you scream 'what it ain't'
(battle zone, goodie)
1999 (yeah)
tlc, m-o-b (and goodie mob)
the synergy of ghetto sounds for the y-2-g
(what'cha wanna do with it?)
what it is, what it ain't
(what?)
either you bring it
(we gon' bring it)
or you can't
sometimes it gets kind of messy out there
(sometimes)
but we get by
(well what'cha wanna do with it)
one day at a time
stuck on me at waffle house
after 1:12, when i go out
where do you hang?
or do you slang?
or wear a chain?
wear platinum rings?
i still maintain my ghetto siren
keep my pride
get in my ride
twenty-inch rims
i sport a brim
and when my girls
go to the mall
around the world
and keep the change
the finest things
we still remain so ooh
you don't even look from across the room
you don't know enough about this world to
ever get it on with me
or hang out where i do
you don't even look from across the floor
you don't have game enough any more
come up on a girl like me
and that's not a possibility cause
you big plastic girl
i'mma big boss man
i like old model cars and big sedans
you like two doors
frontin' their clothes and rolls
or sit on the porch sip something real cold
i like the nine when you up and not o's
i do suits while you prefer the lows
tonight i'mma choose cause you already chose
grown for the business and i run to flow
cause you ain't ghetto enough for me
and you ain't hot enough for me
and you ain't fly enough for me
and you're too tight with your money
cause you ain't ghetto enough for me
and you ain't hot enough for me
and you ain't fly enough for me
and you're too tight with your money
check it baby
so ghetto like hot fries
i come from melvin and resemble
twenty-twenty with his blood shot eyes, got 32 loads
went from two o's to 32 loads
which is enough to buy a roll
but nobody knows
stay in my place
keep my diamonds out of your face
you wanna be with this player
you got play at my pace
i'm slow but i can still come over there from where you're from
if you want some bullshit you better buy you some
you don't even look from across the room
you don't know enough about this world to
ever get it on with me
or hang out where i do
you don't even look from across the floor
you don't have game enough any more
come up on a girl like me
and that's not a possibility cause
shorty with your booty showin'
shorty with your gold teeth
shorty with your long nails
shorty with your fake hair
shorty got the attitude all up in the news
to represent the nineties girl
doing it oh i need to
i got the back you got the front
that's how we do up in the woods
with the bump on the log, ain't no scrubs over here
i'mma ghetto millionaire, can you see me in the clear?
i'mma keep on serving 'em like i'm supposed to baby
cause you ain't ghetto enough for me
and you ain't hot enough for me
and you ain't fly enough for me
and you're too tight with your money
cause you ain't ghetto enough for me
and you ain't hot enough for me
and you ain't fly enough for me
and you're too tight with your money
what it is
(what it ain't)
what it is
(what it ain't)
uh-huh, yeah, what?
don't be suffocating my pockets
while i'm recitating these topics
like where your g's, where your loot?
and you lookin' real dumb when you get the boot
what it is?
my road to me come from some of the hardest of streets
we custom navigate to the club
with some of the hardest of beats
what it ain't
is you sleeping with all the shit i've been through?
cause i'mma keep doing all the things that i gots to do
(i'm ghetto) uh dammit i'll put your ass to work
(i'm ghetto) comb your nappy hair till it hurts
oh what i'm saying
stop using the rope take 'em real off these streets
or you might hurt your throat
you know you ghetto
when you don't show up at court
for not paying your child support
are you too bossier for me?
you act like you too good to eat
at church's, popeye's, and arby's
i shop at walter's bright creek
in a mall with steve and deke
i hang out at bankhead
you prefer buckhead
your favorite color is hot pink
i love that gangsta red
cause you ain't ghetto enough for me
and you ain't hot enough for me
and you ain't fly enough for me
and you're too tight with your money
cause you ain't ghetto enough for me
and you ain't hot enough for me
and you ain't fly enough for me
and you're too tight with your money
cause you ain't ghetto enough for me
and you ain't hot enough for me
and you ain't fly enough for me
and you're too tight with your money
cause you ain't ghetto enough for me
and you ain't hot enough for me
and you ain't fly enough for me
and you're too tight with your money
we'll stop here
yeah, i lost one
