"conspiracy"
you can't tell me life was meant to be like this
a black man in a world dominated by whiteness
ever since the declaration of independence
we've been easily brainwashed by just one sentence
it goes: all men are created equal
that's why corrupt governments kill innocent people
with chemical warfare they created crack and aids
got the public thinking these were things that black folks made
and every time there's violence shown in the media
usually it's a black thing so where are they leading ya
to a world full of ignorance, hatred, and prejudice
tv and the news for years they have fed you this
foolish notion that blacks are all criminals
violent, low lifes, and then even animals
i'm telling the truth so some suckers are fearing me
but i must do my part to combat the conspiracy
the s.a.t. is not geared for the lower class
so why waste time even trying to pass
the educational system presumes you to fail
the next place is the corner then after that jail
you've got to understand that this has all been conspired
to put a strain on our brains so that the strong grow tired
it even exists when you go to your church
cuz up on the wall a white jesus lurks
they use your subconscious to control your will
they've done it for a while and developed the skill
to make you want to kill your own brother man
black against black you see it's part of their plan
they want to send us to war and they want to ban rap
what they really want to do is get rid of us blacks
genocide is for real and i hope that you're hearing me
you must be aware to combat the conspiracy
even in this rap game all that glitters ain't gold
now that rap is big business the snakes got bold
they give you wack contracts and try to make you go pop
cuz they have no regard for real hip-hop
they'll compare you to others and say: "but yo, he sells"
and you know in your heart that he's weak as hell
so you say: "i ain't doing that corny stuff"
but they tell ya that your chart positions will go up
sometimes they front big time and make you many promises
and when they break 'em then your mama says
"son you're making records but that guy seems shady"
it could be too late and your career could be played gee
i hope you listen to the things that i'm sharing see
we all have a job to combat the conspiracy
