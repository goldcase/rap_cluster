"all 4 tha ca$h"
"take the money never have to run"
"here's how it goes.."
all for the cash man, niggaz'll be ready to blast man
mad hoes, 'll be quick, to give up the ass man
traitors, they'll be robbing your stash man
don't wanna end up like the last man
if the price is right, niggaz can get trife awright
they plot and they scheme, all day and all night
and they might even get elaborate enough
to plan the illest kind of crime, fuck the average stuff
like this chick who was kickin it, with this baller
pretendin that she loved him, only really loved dollars
holla'd at his man so they could, rendezvous
said to his man, "forget him, i'm fond of you"
so after the screw, she put him down with her plan
the utmost betrayal, this nigga's down with her man
but the sex changed everything, they conspired to snake him
talked about the best time, and best way, they could take him
while in bed, she told him just where her man kept his dough
she said, "yo, tonight he's bout to cop some blow
and i know, there's at least, 50 grand to show
bring a gat, wear a mask, and come through the window
i'll leave it open for you, he won't never know
so run in, grab the money, later on, you and i can flow
if we do this shit right, he won't fight
break out with the cash and stay your ass out of sight"
so the nigga sat back, but little did he know
he was about to ruin his life over a silly hoe
and really though, the whole shit went wrong
cause when he came through the window and pulled out it was on
money they was gon' rob was high, on some shit
dukes with the mask, told him, "run your shit"
he said, "fuck that shit!"  so they tussled n shit
then blaow, the burner spit, and the chick's man got hit
he died, his man had no loyalty, she's locked up as an accessory
his man's doin life, what a tragedy
all for the cash man..
"never have to run"
