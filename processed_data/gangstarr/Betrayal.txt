-scarface is tight son
yo that's a good idea word is bond
i'm gonna talk the play in tomorrow (yeah) and
see about if we could hook up wit him
-that's proper
scandalous, money greed and lust
in this trife life, there ain't nobody you can trust
plus there's no justice, it's just us
in fact, watchin' yo back it be must
and each and everyday around the way gats bust
and jealous so-called friends'll try to set you up
it's called betrayal
check the horror scene
the kid was like twelve or thirteen
never had the chance like other kids to follow dreams
watched his father catch two in the dome and to the spleen
nothin" but blood everywhere, these streets are mean
they spared his life, but killed his moms and his sister jean
of course over some drug shit
hi spops was on some ill-out, spill your guts, on some thug shit
didn't know his boys was on some shady ass no love shit
his pops got played out though, with silencers they laid him out yo
took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
with tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out
cause his dad was the nigga with clout
survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him doe
and taught him, to use the same gat
supposed to be an uncle,fam and all that
he could tell it was him 'cause he wore the same slacks, he wore when
he took him to meadowlands racetrack
why did he flip and go out like that?
it's called betrayal
a betrayal
punk ass niggas
it's called betrayal
he on a mission to become a ball player
flip big benz's, flossin all gators
had it all mapped out,6-8,12th grader
fresh outta school, he fin' to go lay paper
he had abrother who was hustlin collectin his change
never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
and he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
so now he's pacin as the time moves slowly
can't wait to face shaquille in the paint and school kobe
kept his grades and stayed up under naighborhood functions
and then a group of knuckleheads came through dumpin
so now he's sittin on the sidewalk bleedin
fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin
and everybody in the neighborhood still grievin
but destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
and all the cryin in the world ain't goin to bring him back
his brother, sittin at the wake wipin tears from his mother's eyes
why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
only the wicked live shife, payin the price
while he's starin at the shell
his brothers soul wants hell the trigger man made bail
and you, wouldn't pay the boys mail, and sacrificed the fuckin family
that's betrayal
betrayal
