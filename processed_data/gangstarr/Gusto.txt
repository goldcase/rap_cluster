"gusto" lyrics
gang starr lyrics
"gusto"
keith e.e. emcee on a spree i'm goin for this
cause draws applause, yes i adore this
i'll reteach with speech, i can accomplish
i've got to flaunt this, i'm not a pessimist
yo i'm an optimist, that's why i'm droppin this
i'm good i got style, cause i've stood for a while
in the shadows of the others gettin mellow with the brothers
called the gang, and yes i can hang
progressin with my lesson while i do my thang
i've got gusto
"my man gots that gusto" "word"
you say your rhymes flow, i say i'm spontaneous
rockin the place, i'm not mainly just
sayin some words that are weak or incoherent
and it's apparent, that you fear us, the gang
but i'm still a peace seeker
i'm in your face, don't have to sneak ya
dope rhymes speaking with wisdom of a preacher
and i'm here, cause you've been victimized
i'm sincere, i see through gifted eyes
so yo, we're gonna see what the race is
that's where you groups, will have to face us
and you can bet we'll be in tip-top shape
nice so precise with a hip-hop update
wait, i got a shoutout for the ladies
come check me baby, don't underrate me
cause i'm a man with the plan for all
the guru, to groove you, get out the wall
i've got gusto
"my man gots that gusto" "word"
i've got gusto, so i'm kickin it well
i got gusto, with much clientele
so i pump it, to a higher decibel
have a seat, listen cause the rest it goes smooth
and improve and bust a move
i am the man with the true blue potential
i am essential, i drive you mental and back
attack mack and rap
and as you calm i will romp
like a giant i stomp
i've got gusto
"my man gots that gusto" "word"
really?  right, you wanna be a emcee?
then go against me -- boy don't even tempt me
cause i go house on the freestyle tip
math you and blast you and then just shift
into hype gear, no fear, i persevere
year after year, rehearsin verse so clear
cause i've been into rhymin man for like eons
and every stage, word i wanna be on
so i can show you how it's gotta be done
i never run or shun, i've just begun
i've got gusto
"my man gots that gusto" "word"
..
"my man gots that gusto" "word"
ahhh yeah... gusto...
