"it's gettin hectic"
(feat. brand new heavies)
i set if off by letting you know that i can flow to many beats
similar to flu so freely
and you can say i'm getting kind of greedy
but so what 'cause i'm supplying the needy
well some mc's go for there it be i buried the
remain of the other 'cause they suck incredibly
superficial styles only last a little while
but they'll never hold a candle to the gangstarr profile
more than just wit and more than just intellect
and more than a gangster 'cause i kill wit a mic check
and i'm no the one wit the h on his back meaning the herb
i like the funky beats, i like the cur
most likely in a blunt as i roll it really steady
then i get mentally ready
ans play a track from the heavies and mellow out
'cause my main objective is to be more effective
it's getting hectic, it's getting crazy
i'ts getting hectic, it's getting wild
and when the mic stands free, i then step to the
point of attack 'cause the track feels good to me
and i intend to break ya out of your restraints
'cause you gain interest in my lines like i'm city bank
and thanks to the brand new heavies and everyone
who can dig the movement of the guru, smooth and
proving that i'm the relevent, eloquent one
suckers getting whoopings like they're all my sons
remembering rap from the days of it's origin
the power of many men ascend from my pen
dissing the ones wit the fame and claiming they're hard
yo, them, i disregard
'cause they ain't all cracked up to what they should be
some like are wannabees and some like are wouldbees
and i'm getting vexed by the crap they project
they put in on wax and all their records still racks
rearranging the script is my worst shift gear in a flash
putting cash in a stash, ain't nuttin funny, money
much greater gifts, i receive, are those who are blessed
and me, i got a treasure chest
by all means protected at all times
you try to front and you'll pay more than a small fine
i don't brag about the stuff i did
i simply roll correctly, demolishing stupid kids
and they're running off wit the lip and not accomplishing zip
i tell 'em, wake up son 'cause this is it
peep out the suckers who are faking
flaking moves on the mic and in life
strife is what i give them 'cause i'm living how i should be
and you better move 'cause the groove is like deadly
and no, you ain't all that and many ain't legit
so i'm a put a mark for they get bust
yo gangstarr, 1991 into 92 and beyond
lounging wit the brand new heavies,
dj premier and the guru from brroklyn
peace out
