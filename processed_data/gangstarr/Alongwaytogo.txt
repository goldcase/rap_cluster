"alongwaytogo"
now here's a funky introduction
it's alongwaytogo, when you don't know where you're going
you don't know where you're going when you're lost (lost)
what you need is more direction and get yourself some protection
i thought by now that you have learned your lesson
i'm stressin points and slammin all joints you call the real shit
correct shit, you know the busta way you feel shit
baby, i still don't think you understand
you lose the game, we get more props than dan...rather
and it don't matter cuz when you flinch, you're weak
so i'mma step just to speak about the counterfeit, unlegit type of people
those cellophane ones, the ones that you can see through
it's poetic justice cuz i'm mad with a pact
so precise, my insight will take flight in the night
and in the daytime, cuz i don't come up with corny rhymes
i'm too devoted to the concept of gettin mine
so here's the deal like shaquille o'neal
if you don't know what you're doing, how the hell can you be real?
how far must you go to gain respect? um...
now in '93, realistically you should be...well aware of all the evils out there
it's like a jungle sometimes. you get the message?
you got to rumble sometimes, it's gettin hectic
emotions run deep, as times run out
solutions...it's time to find some out
so according to me, suckers are barred
from obstructing my discussion cuz i rhyme too hard
you take a wiff like a spliff here, like some fresh air
i came to claim shit this year (this year)
so take a stroll down the walkway, or hallway, or runway
fuck with us, kid, you'll pay
i slay...and yo, i'm still on the expressway
i kick my essay, then you know we don't play
so pray down on your knees, g
cuz it's the best way, yes, the best way, cuz...
there's a large amount of wack crews. for them, i got bad news
time to pay your dues, you fools
i'm like express mail, with the script that hits
like the third rail, when i shock the spot, it's hot
from the rays of the sun
original one the prophet sent to become
a law giver, cuz you shiver when i quiz ya
all about the real neccessities of life
all about the game and all about the name
g to the a to the n to the g starr
we know who we are, but do you know who you are?
( you go down there looking for justice, that's what you find, just us)
um...
