"step in the arena" lyrics
gang starr lyrics
"step in the arena"
"step up..." over and over
once you step in the arena, cheater; you're gonna be a-
mazed when you gaze at the armor on this leader
fully clad and glad to find a cause, i won't pause
fear is a joke, slowpoke, i'm like claws
that'll rip 'cause your gift, is merely flesh
superficial and i wish you, would give it a rest
but if you don't, i'll unsheath my excalibur
like a noble knight, so meet ya challenger
a true hero, while you're a through zero
gettin beat to a pulp so that you can't run for help
i heard a gulp in your throat, cause you hope that i'll be merciful
but coo-cluck, i made you strut as i rehearse a few
battle drills, and watch your bladder spill
yellow fluid, check out how i mellowed into it
face to feet to defeat, you can tell i'm into it
as i'm pullin out my lance, to kill you and advance to
the winner's throne; cause i own you once you step in the arena
"step up..." over and over
in the arena... or rather colliseum
there's people gatherin by multitudes to see one
perpretrator fall to the dust after the other
quickly disposed of at the hand of a known brother
born wit the art in his heart that is spartacus
and one-to-one combat jack, just a thought of this
match-up, makes gangstarr wanna snatch up
one or two phrases from the new book with new pages
of rhymes that are built like a chariot
dope vocals carry it, to the battle set
if a beat was a princess, i would marry it
but now i must bow to the crowd as i stand proud
victorius, glorious, understand now
cause battles and wars and much fights i have been through
one mc got beheaded, and you can too
forget it, cause you'd rather be just a spectator
an onlooker, afraid you may get slayed or
struck by a blow, from a mic gladiator
i betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
cause you stepped up, chest puffed out
and in just one lyric, you got snuffed out
cause rhymin is serious, i'm strong, i'm like hercules
you'll get hurt with these lines, close the curtains please
and suckers can jet cause i wreck once you step in the arena
"step inside my... arena" over and over
in the arena or forum, weak mc's i will floor 'em
causin mayhem, i'll slay them, and the blood'll be pourin
furthermore i implore, that as a soldier of war
i go in only to win and be the holder of more
trophies, titles, and triumphs cause i dump all the sly chumps
never choosin to lose my spot, not once
for the mere idea of an opponent that i fear
is foolish utterly, i mean but none'll be
tryin to toy wit a destroyer of many
you shitted your pants cause you can't figure any
foe that can step to this concept so
tou better sit again citizen, weak mc's i get rid of them
watch the way they get distraught when they get caught
in the worst positions, cause they didn't listen
and tried goin up against a hungry killer who's itchin
to mame and murder, those who claimed that they were the
toughest ones, they get done once they step in the arena
"step inside my... arena"
