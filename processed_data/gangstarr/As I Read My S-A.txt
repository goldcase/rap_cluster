"as i read my s-a" lyrics
gang starr lyrics
"as i read my s-a"
"at this time i have the honor to present to you"
parahraphs, portraying my viewpoint
so stay attentive, cause this is a new joint
from the g-a-n-g with the info
lyrical elements emerge from the intro
forming a poetic mass over pathetic trash
other writers are outclassed
surpassed by the words and the wit
rhymes fit and hit cause that's how we designed it
page for page, we are the new age
dope in the videos and dope when we're on stage
commanding respect with my ink pen while suckers are sinking
as i'm keeping them thinking
narrating phrases of value, and i can see now you
relate to what i create
from back in the days of my youth, i've looked for the truth
and yo my rhymes are the real proof
new heights and new realms have been reached
by use of my speech along with one of premier's beats
so listen and we'll show you the best way
and then sway, as i read my s-a
worshipful words giving insight, so just be observant
so you can get this right
my oratory gift is abundant, so dazzling to minds
that you should come get
a glimpse of the one who puts wimps out of work
the script is a mess and they dress like they're jerks
beyond them, is where i'll be dwellin
the guru will tell em, why their records ain't sellin
placin my fingers on the tool, i runaway all fools
when i'm dispersin a verse
think of an enjoyable moment, then boogie your body
cause this party i own it
the origin of this is on paper
vibes will ascend from my mind to each line
i go with the flow as i show expertise
the powers increase as my voice hits the streets
then gripping your soul with authority
i pour these rhymes in a cup so drink up
and then i might bring another round
watch the sound pound from the floor to the ground
and keep aware, cause we'll show you the best way
and then sway, as i read my s-a
