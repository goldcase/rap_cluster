"let me see it"
let me see it, hold up...hol' up
let me see it, uh...hol' up...let me see it
let me see it...
bend over lemme see it
let me see it...
bend over lemme see it..
now, from the city that i live in
to the city where i'm from
for all the hoes that we done did
and the hoes that we ain't done
from the ones that fuck for shrimp
to the ones that fuck for cum:
if you ain't fittin' ta fuck pimp
then you ain't fittin' ta fuck bun
got some hoes from the 'hood ('hood)
that live to keep it live (live)
and some office buildin' boppers (boppers)
workin' 9 to 5 (five)
ball playa baby mama bitches;
but to me it ain't no thang
let that monkey hang, baby
let me see it..
let me see it, let me see it
let me see it, let me see it
let me see it, let me see it
bend over, let me see it..
go'on and let a nigga peak (peak)
and let a nigga poke (poke)
fuck a nigga from his street (street)
and let a nigga stroke (stroke)
see, i know that you a freak (freak)
from passin' to my folk (folk)
let me bust it in yo' cheek (cheek)
'til you muthafuckin' choke (choke)
it's nothin' but a g thang, baby, when you suck it
steady frontin' in yo' g-strang
go'on lemme fuck it
see, we know that you a pro (pro)
from shakin' and tuckin'
we some grown muthafuckas
like ta get naked, buck it
from the back (back), to the front (front)
and to the side (side)
in the 'lac ('lac), wit' a blunt (blunt)
now, where the light (light)?
it's a fact (fact): i've seen it
lemme get in between it
now, over bend, once again
bitches, show it like ya mean it..
uh...take it off, chick
bend over, lemme see it
i'm sweet james jones
and a trick: i couldn't be it
got a young brown stallion
and she 20 years old
when she pop it from the back
you see that hairy asshole
from the a-t-l hoes, to the h-town strippers
to the boppers in deville
that's suckin' us and pullin' zippers
now, it how it make ya feel when you see a pimp shine?
bitch, you wastin' too much time..
get back up on yo' grind (grind, grind...)
i'm a country-ass nigga;
i fucked wit' yo' wife..
if yo' bitch come around
we put some dick in her life
'cause them niggas ain't real
must'a started smokin' rocks
it all fell down
'cause they was bitin' too much cock
but what goes up, must come down..
while these bitches suckin' dick
and droppin' to the ground..
every city, every town:
i'm ballin' in the mix
i'm servin' niggas bricks
keep a bad yellow bitch
on my team...sippin' lean
ain't no thang of the past;
the '84 beritz with the slant-back ass
keepin' me a pro, next to my fo'
instead of stackin' cheese
he steady screamin' to that ho..
let me see it
fuck-ass nigga..
ol' fuck-ass nigga, get yo' mind on yo' money
hol' up...hol' up (uh)...ugk, bitch
uh (uh)...representin' that south...that south
and this ain't no muthafuckin'...hip hop records (fuck ass nigga);
these country rap tunes
hol' up...uh
so, you could separate us from the rest..
like i tol' you the last time
