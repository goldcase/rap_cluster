"international player's anthem (i choose you)"
(feat. outkast)
so, i typed a text to a girl i used to see
sayin that i chose this cutie pie with whom i wanna be
and i apologize if this message gets you down
then i cc'd every girl that i'd see see round town and
i hate to see y'all frown but i'd rather see her smiling
wetness all around me, true, but i'm no island
peninsula maybe, makes no sense i know, crazy
give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no lookin back
spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
they dip as quick as they can
the atmosphere is now ripped
im so like a pip, im glad its night
so the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
when i shoot the moon high, jump the broom
like a premie out the womb
my partner yellin "too soon! dont do it! reconsider!
read some litera - ture on the subject
you sure? fuck it
you know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
if that bitch do you dirty
we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
i know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what i taught ya
keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
play your part
play your part"
sweet jones
by bitch a choosey lover, never fuck without a rubber
never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
money on the dresser, drive a compressor
top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
trash like the fuck for 40 dollars in the club
fucking up the game, bitch you gets no love
she be cross country givin all that she got
a thousand a pop, im pullin bentleys off the lot
i smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
your bitch chose me, you aint a pimp you a fairy
ooooooohhh ooooooohhh
i choose you girl
baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
because its greener on that other side if you know what i mean
i'll show you shit you've never seen
the 7 wonders of the world
and i can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
when i say my girl i don't mean my woman, that aint my style
need a real streets stalker to walk a green mile
we burnin up the paper on the dining room table
cause you able to realize i'm the truth and not a fable
we rockin precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
what i look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
im a million dollar mack, need a billion dollar bitch
put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
easy as a b c, simple as 1 2 3
get down with ugk, pimp c, b u n b
cause whats a hoe with no pimp, and whats a pimp with no hoes
dont be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
we tryin to get jones
oooooooohhh ooooooohhh
i choose you girl
eni mini decisions with precision i pick
or make my selection on who i choose to be with
girl dont touch my protection, i know you want it to slip
but slippin is something i dont do, tippin for life? (mmm mmm!)
thats like makin it rain
every month on schedule (mmmhhmm!) let me tell you
get your parasol umbrella cause its gonna get wetter
better prepare you for the c support
she supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she dont
ask ask paul mccartney the lawyers gettin sloppy
slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
send her into outer space, i know he wish he could
cause he payin 20k a day, that bitch is eating good
like an infant on a double d tity is getting plump
cause he miscalculated the next to the last bump
dump dump in the gut, walk from the giddy up
better chose the right one or pick pick the kitties up
ooooohhhhh ooooooohhh
i chose you girl
iiiiiiii
i chose you baby
