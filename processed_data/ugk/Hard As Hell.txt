"hard as hell"
ooh ay ay
ooh ay ay
ooh ay ay
it's akon and ugkayyy
and ugkayyy
and ugkayyy
it's akon
that girl she got me the way she movin in place
bendin over spreadin eagle all that ass in my face
she got me hard as hell
got me pokin like a nail
she got me hard as hell
i can't control it can't you tell baby
show me whatcha workin with
ever got knocked out on a brotha kid
i keep a gold magnum rubber with some k-y
tryna see where i'm cummin from get it in your eye (in your eye)
i like when ya get downnn like a gus of poles
rolled on a dolphin get that shit up out your nose
is that where all your money goes
i spend mine on bendz and roles
royces choices get on the pole
slide down move around and bring that money back home
he ain't pimp hes a clone
wanna eat my dick when it smell my cologne
i'm so thrown in a gang like that
the good cat ball but the motha fucka fat
girl whatcha gonna do with all that
can see your missin t's i hithca from the back
that girl she got me the way she movin in place
bendin over spreadin eagle all that ass in my face
she got me hard as hell
got me pokin like a nail
she got me hard as hell
i can't control it can't you tell baby
she was 36 24 40
centerfold stallion uh life of the party
all eyes on her and that goes for me too
five inch heels and a dress that's see through
as soon as i saw her i knew that it was time
as soon as she saw me she knew that she was mine
if this is a dream then i don't wanna wake
and if this is as good as it seems commone you gotta shake
the body's not real it look like crunk drew her
if she don't step to me i'm finna run to her
and off top man my mouth will drop man
and for a minute it felt like the world just stopped man
then started again and now i'm startin to feel like i could really give
baby girl i hearted a tril and once you got the heart
you got the dope but right now we gots to go cause baby girl gots ta know
that girl she got me the way she movin in place
bendin over spreadin eagle all that ass in my face
she got me hard as hell
got me pokin like a nail
she got me hard as hell
i can't control it can't you tell baby
the boyz we mean they on bended knee
make it disappear you want the texas t
girls in france like texas d

mercie voku baby girl you know you
got the hot butter my knife gotta go through
sometimes it cuts slow sometimes it cut quick
it don't matter cause it's still good dick come on
shorty got me swollen now
chicka say wanna nigga hold her now
grippin the tie she ready to bone me now
diggin up in that belly got her moanin now
and round and round i go
when i come up and down she go
when she cum everybody know
when we cum moneys on the floor baby
that girl she got me the way she movin in place
bendin over spreadin eagle all that ass in my face
she got me hard as hell
got me pokin like a nail
she got me hard as hell
i can't control it can't you tell baby
that girl she got me the way she movin in place
bendin over spreadin eagle all that ass in my face
she got me hard as hell
got me pokin like a nail
she got me hard as hell
i can't control it can't you tell baby.
