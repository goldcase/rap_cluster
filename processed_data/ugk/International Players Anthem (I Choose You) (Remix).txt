"international player's anthem (i choose you) (remix)"
(feat. three 6 mafia)
hypnotize minds, ugk!
three 6 mafia, another classic baby
put some south in your mouth
it's goin down, what!
sweet jones
my bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
money on the dresser, drive a compressor
top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
fuckin up the game, bitch it gets no love
she be cross country, givin all that she got
a thousand a pop, i'm pullin bentleys off the lot
i smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
every time we hit the parkin lot we turn head
some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy
{"ohhhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhh i choose you girl, yeah..."}
baby you been rollin solo, time to get down with the team
the grass is greener on that other side if you know what i mean
i show you shit you never seen, the seven wonders of the world (world)
and i can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl (girl)
when i say my girl i don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile (mile)
we pilin up the paper on the dinin room table
cause you able to realize i'm the truth and not a fable (fable)
we rock the freshest sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
what i look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
i'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
put my pimpin in your life, watch your daddy get rich
easy as a-b-c, simple as 1-2-3
get down with ugk, pimp c, b-u-n b
cause what's a hoe with no pimp? and what's a pimp with no hoes?
don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
we tryin to get chose
{"ohhhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhh i choose you girl, yeah..."}
now when they heard who in the club dj paul, bitches chosen up
when they see i'm nice and like a slush, then they frozen up
like my homie project pat we keep them cups raising up
snizzle fizzay kiz-off in my dollar, gotta nose it up
i dial drink by the liters, i'm a drinker hoe
before you doin it like meeee you's a thinker hoe
what you thinkin row? need to get your money way up
ugk and three 6 mafia got your girl creamed up
i'm still trappin in hell, my pockets are swelled
the number one d-boy, mr. fishscale
i don't fuck around, with snitches who tell
put holes in your brain, leave bodies to smell
a mack here gettin paid, ain't got time for jail
i paid off the judges, the jury, the sheriff
you know it's the truth, may never we'll fail
i'm still "sippin' syrup", slow motion like snails
{"ohhhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhh i choose you girl, yeah...
ahhhhhhhhhhhh, i choose you baby..."}
