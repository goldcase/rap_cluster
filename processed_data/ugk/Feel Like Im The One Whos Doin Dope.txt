"feel like i'm the one who's doin' dope"
i woke up at twelve on the dot
went to my closet and i checked my matchbox
two rocks gone, that's the third time this week
so i'm going to the bedroom to check this freak
i said yo bitch some mo' of my dope is gone
i know that you stole it so bitch you know it's on
she said before you kill me, here's a little token, the other night
i walked into the bedroom and it was you that was smokin
i said nah bitch as i shot her in the head, picked up my shirt from the side of the bed
picked up my keys off the dresser, stood over the bitch, blew her a kiss then i left her
i remember waking up later on that night, i'm in lafayette and some shit just ain't right
my head feels tight and my mouth taste strange
plus some bitch is in my trunk calling out my real name
how she know my name? did i tell her? who told her?  yo what's the tip?
plus i feel a fever blister coming on my fuckin' lip
and you don't get that shit from smokin' buddha
the other night i woke up, in my hand was a straight-shooter
i could smell crack burnin' in the fuckin' air
i looked down, i didn't have on no underwear
looked in my other hand and it was full of nut
i looked around, i'm butt-naked on the cut, i think i'm the one that's doing dope
( i feel like i'm the one that's doing dope)
shit, i can't cope
( i feel like i'm the one that's doing dope)
shit, i can't cope
( i feel like i'm the one that's doing dope)
i can't cope
( i feel like i'm the one that's doing dope)
shit, i can't cope
( i feel like i'm the one that's doing dope)
huh, i can't cope
( i feel like i'm the one that's doing dope)
shit, i can't cope
( i feel like i'm the one that's doing dope)
so get the rope
( i feel like i'm the one that's doing dope)
fuck
my nigga bird came and picked me up
took me to alvester and my mama cleaned me up
i'm feelin' half alive and i'm feelin' half dead
it felt kinda funny sleepin' in my old bed
my pager went off and it said to call my home
i put my drink down and i picked up the phone
pat said a nigga just dropped off my pack
i went to crook and told him drive me up to san jac
but when i got to san jac, i put the key in the door
it didn't hit, man this is a chance for some fucked up shit
i started knocking and a white man came to the door
i pulled my pistol and i shot the motherfuckin' hoe
went to my bedroom, there's a white bitch in my bed
i told her up the pussy bitch and give me some fuckin' head
she said i'll give you all my money just don't kill me though
i told the bitch that all i wanted was some pussy hoe
pussy was good but as i felt that second nut
i pulled my dick out, grabbed my knife and shoved it in her gut
i turned the knife around and shot nut on her chest
look in her eyes and i can hear her take her last breath
and as i got up i look and yo it wasn't my bed
i look down, my carpet is tan this carpetis bloody red
this ain't my house it's one street away
i can't cope
i feel like i'm the one that's doing fucking dope!
i check myself into
i'mma hurt myself if i don't get shit straight
to top the shit off they just give me more dope
i think i'm crazy now i'm at the end of my rope
my mama comes to see me every motherfuckin day
as much as i want to, i don't have nothing to say
i want to say i love her with all my damn heart
but hustlin' is a fiend and yo it's tearing her apart
i woke up that night with that same taste in my mouth
my mind just went bezerk, i gotta break the fuck out
i killed the bitch that's sitting at the front booth
i broke the guard's neck and twist on his fucking suit
took his keys and got to the doorway
in about 2 seconds, it's a smooth getaway
got to the truck and i'm gone scot-free
what the fuck? a siren motherfucker's after me
if they take me they gon' have to take me dead
before i go i'll put a bullet in my head
i try to hold 'em back but the teardrops comin' down
i let my foot off the gas and put my head to the ground
i put the gun to my temple and then i went click
i heard a ringing sound and woke up to my hard dick
i was crying, my girl told me chad it's just a dream
i guess i ain't no motherfuckin' fiend
hahahahaha
