"money, hoes & power"
(feat. jermaine dupri)
yeah
ha ha
yeah
that's right
motherfuckers, come on!
it's that lil' college park nigga, in fact, they call me "long dough"
niggas hate me cause i'm wearin' platinum every song go (yeah)
hoes love me cause i, cause i keep it comin' strong and yo
i'm a pimp with mine every time i don't give a fuck who she is
bitch, you can go (get out!)
get another cause they love us niggas in the fast life
niggas that can put it down and came up with they cash right (yeah)
keep em', keep em' in the mall fresh, ball every night
that's my life, i come through any time i want to and hit that ass right
up like a flashlight, walkin' cause of all of my bling (bling!)
one of the baddest motherfuckers that the game has seen (ha ha), think about it
from the first time that ya heard me (yeah)
way back in the 90s early (yeah)
me and my pimpin' out here doin' our thing in swat
i got the money, hoes and power
we be in to see that ya cuttin', i'm all about cha'
but if ya not up in the mix, girl, i ain't trippin'
cause all day, all night, i be steady pimpin', pimpin'
still smokin' out, pourin' up, keep these bitches hoin' up
they break pimp c long bread cause everything i touch be blowin' up
candy car, i'm a star
choppin' blades, sippin' on bar
young pimp, i'm from the south
run off put that piece in ya mouth
we jone, fuck a clone
keep a lil' bitch on my phone
all my cars blaze chrome
bitch can't leave my dick alone, alone, alone
you ain't from no memphis, bitch
cause i was playin' project pat, hittin' the switch
puttin' the dick up in ya dame
every time make her say my name
91, i been grippin' grain
bitch nigga wanna steal my fame, fame, fame
i be at home smokin' dro, dro
and see a nigga doin' a dance on the video
but i'm young pimp, steak and shrimp
flyin' high like a blimp
write my name in the sky on track
tell the bitch to bring my money back, back, back, back, bitch
(he talkin' directly to you)
i got the money, hoes and power
we be in to see that ya cuttin', i'm all about cha'
but if ya not up in the mix, girl, i ain't trippin'
cause all day, all night, i be steady pimpin', pimpin'
(talk to me, talk to me)
well if it ain't cash, then i don't want it
i'm a million dollar striver, i get liver
than the pimps that push clock punchers nine-to-fiver
a high diver (yo), with mo' tricks up my sleeve than ya boy macguyver
a cadaver, that'll get cha' voted off my island like "survivor" (shit!)
is you blind (blind)? my pimpin' only gets better with age like a fine wine
and it's time (time) to put up yo blinds
i might raise a pimp to shine
decide to yo mind, design
two steps ahead of yo slow roll
you best to get a grip on ya world, world
or we'll put that "miracle whip" on ya girl
pimp her, let a trick sip on that pearl
let her pay that is
ol' sucker for love, titty baby, mama's boy
that's just the way that is
and that's the way that it's goin' be, way that it's goin' be
so ya might as well take ya lil' heartbreak hotel reside
stuck in the mud, but still ridin' ass off to mo' me
cause, uh...
i got the money, hoes and power
we be in to see that ya cuttin', i'm all about cha'
but if ya not up in the mix, girl, i ain't trippin'
cause all day, all night, i be steady pimpin', pimpin'
bounce, come on, bounce, come on, bounce
come on, keep bouncin'
bounce, come on, bounce, come on, bounce, come on, keep bouncin'
bounce, come on, bounce, come on, bounce
