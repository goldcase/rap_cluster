"take tha hood back"
(feat. slim thug, vicious and middle fingaz)
now all my hustlers, grinders and ballas
open up your mind
a lot of niggas hustlin backwards
need to press rewind
there's some niggas playin dirty pool
back alley bandits
they crossin up the trill
and man ya boy just can't stand it
mothafuckas need to be repremanded and straight checked
these boys is givin the wrong niggas out here respect
break ya neck to fuck with a nigga then compromise your hood
ya doin shit you know ain' cool
and to the good
got kids movin work, hustlin by the school
using youngsters they hits stages, whole shit on the cool
matter fact, fuck the cool
you niggas need to hear me
breakin bread with certified snitches
don't come near me (don't come near me)
you niggas givin these canaries all these passes
fuckin gettin dough with a snitch

long time offender
lose yo ass, get enhanced
speak not, keep yo mouth shut
investigate the whole place
make em think it's cool
follow that nigga round the whole day
the game ain't the same
it all changed for the worst
nigga got the less time cause he came with it first
see i disperse to dope amongst convicted felons
strictly gs, no more glock shit, rock shit
strictly keys
i get my paper
i was taught older niggas
cold blooded killas, dope dealers
soldier niggas, i'm alert
i'm aware, i'm focused, i'm on top and shit
i show you how to stop that bitch
get ignit with this choppa bitch
tomorrow ain't promised

we know your spot, me and my niggas gon ride tonight

damn, i coulda swore they gave yo ass 10 flat
now you're home, somethin wrong
