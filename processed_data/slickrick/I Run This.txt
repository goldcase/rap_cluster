"i run this" lyrics
slick rick lyrics
"i run this"
"mc... ricky... d"
"okay party people in the house"
"this is the original grand wizard"
"something funky push that in em"
"ricky... d"
is it a custom - to what?  to provoke out a hostile apostle
and make him smack the coke out your nostril
bap, the butter cat at gutter rappin and i'm all man
whatever gotta happen gotta happen
boy don't make me put my grown man shoe in you
and i'm sorry father, for any wrongdoing doin you
cause dogs barkin and the girl sigh
here to present myself as the sparkle of the world's eye
picture i - where spice girls chick arrived
england, january 14th, six-five
while you scream out brannyville
"you old ass rapper!"  you got it, but can he still
sever, in other words, rap more clever
like no other younger rapper walkin could ever?
apparently i done this, on this
stunned his behind - out the way of who reign
i run this
"hurry up, run"
"run, run, run, r-run"
"hurry up, run"
out the way of who reign, i run this
"run.. run, r-run"
stop the world kid, bring it home slick
"run, r-run" "run, r-run"
are, you, ready? "run"
the fact is, mack caught cable in an actress
and really is the black clark gable of the rap biz
racists reactin, hastin for action
the motherfucker got exquisite taste for a black man
what you never know?  all clothes come off a hoe
ever see me with my jewels and toast from off of mo'?
*psssh*  past where handsome measures
like the whole entire rat pack, and some precious
and chartable, such a big spark i pull
nuns even say, "that motherfucker's remarkable!"
and aliens who came to earth gathering
"great gosh the man has soul, we must have him"
like a ?, there isn't none after me
liz will throw away her walker and run after me
snatch crowns - done this, on this
stunned his behind - out the way of who reign
i run this
"hurry up, run"
"run, run, run, r-run"
"hurry up, run"
out the way of who reign, i run this
"run, r-run" "as we go"	"run, r-run"
"run, r-run" "as we go"	"run, r-run"
"run, r-run" "as we go"	"run, r-run"
"as we go a little somethin like this, hit it!"
up hastings, crew downfaced and lose
either one way or the other, foundation choose
although the prune i kick, i didn't come to wound a sick child
hit a lost world, actin like a lunatic
who provoke til a heard of smoke
forced good men to pull out and start to murder folk
tired of the basement placed in
take responsibility for your action as a race then
instead of put cheer in our bone, paperhood promote
negativity, and fear in our own neighborhood
since royalty breed to be (uh-huh)
and i puts small seed where small seed need to be
like an angel tend to fly as, mention i as
i didn't make the laws, but they make sense to my ass
while waitin for the world end, won this
stunned his behind - out the way of who reign
i run this
see what i mean kid?
"hurry up, run"
that patch-eyed motherfucker run this
"run, run, run, r-run"
"hurry up, run"
i run this
"run, r-run" "run, r-run"
"run, r-run" "run, r-run"
"run, r-run" "run, r-run"
are, you, ready?? "run"
run thissssssssssssssssss
"hurry up, run"
"run, run, run, r-run"
"hurry up, run"
yeah baby, slick rick
1999, 2000, the whole damn thing kid it's all mine
go away
"mc"  "ricky d"
