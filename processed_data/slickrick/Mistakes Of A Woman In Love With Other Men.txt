"mistakes of a woman in love with other men"
call me the freaker, i bump it in ya speaker
week on my birthday, met this girl named tameka
astonishing creature, made the rest look tired
desired, that was the beauty i admired
out by the 41 brook, no joke
can i have a toke, finally, she smiled and smoked
gave the girl my number, though i still felt rejected
hectic, called me more than i expected
months passed by, even lived together and all
dream come true, until suddenly a call
oh brother, why do i discover
my honey, tameka, yeah callin me another
it started again, it offend and i pretend
mistakes of a woman in love with other men
"how low can go"/"hold it now"
well, tried to block it out my mind, here it was again:
other men, confronted lady and she said he was a friend
didn't believe her, she packed, brave her
strange behavior, so silly, we forgave her
late again thursday, alone rick sat
left flat, look in the mirror and i wonder where she at
gave the girl my heart and soul, it's after 10
and again couldn't manage if she slept wit other men
out wearing my jewelry so you know she looked truck
struck 3 o'clock, here she come, fishy like a fuck
come and let me smell you, i wanted to say to hell you
hi honey, sorry i'm late, but let me tell you
it's a fast chat, need the phone, slow rollin
could you go to the store and get some soda cuz they open
again it offend and i pretend
mistakes of a woman in love with other men
"how low can go"/"hold it now"
strike one, strike two, no exaggeration
try to play it off like it was my imagination
beer mix wit alcohol, help me to forgive
deal wit weak minded and i have no where to live
i deserve honesty, get treated it like a pet
i should be in list, but no i still can't forget
put the cards on the table, don't get loud, cut the bull out
if you slept wit another man, i'm strong enough to pull out
she confess and then she left, smooth
wanted to kill myself cuz to live ain't the move
broke-hearted again, it offend and i pretend
mistakes of a woman in love with other men
once again it offend, and i pretend
mistakes of a woman in love with other men
once again it offend, and i pretend
mistakes of a woman in love with other men
once again it offend, and i pretend
mistakes... in love with other men
how low can you - how low can you go
