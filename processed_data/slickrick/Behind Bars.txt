"behind bars"
"this type of shit that happens every day"
in the slammer kid but i'm innocent
lord played witty wasn't having any pity
now in razor blade city
cry suppose the situation seen mad eyes of foes
drives a rolls, hey, yo, money, what size are those?
need to phone me til another sprang up, hmm, to gang up
on the skid, housing the phone like he didn't know how to hang up
would be hard though ought a minute or so and then yells time on a
and when you get your commisary, buy this and that or else i'm gonna
be on that ass and won't stay off, extort, fig i say, way off
beaten death, you ain't protecting me, forgot today's my day off
hold my head and drift the sumo weigh in knots and cars
instead of sitting here accumulating cuts and scars, behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
showing off cause on the phone, click, losing all the hoes off
niggas housed the watch and donna took all of the clothes off
nigga hell with the was for my clothes figured telling
every night it seem like mice be in and out a nigga cell and
still ain't home, like on the hook, seen a bunch of kids look
miss outdoors, never know what you have until it's tooken
and in fact, the moment you fear, all of that, you quote snaps
well in a cell, did the exercises and wrote raps
i be a bigger star than you, no never heard of the nigga
takes my raps and read aloud, i want to murder the migga
just kidding, no offend to it, finally he ended it
case dismissed, but your honor, da kindly prevented it
he told to the judge, don't free him, this brother trigger wars
and not just that because i refuse to wash some jive nigga doors
so hold the head, drift the sumo weight in knots and cars
instead of sitting here accumulating cuts and scars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
one fight, the nigga trip, c.o. the rest he might scared
by couldn't squeal, i's like officer that nigga right there
now if he ain't get me his friends will, needed a utensil
it turn out, i had to stab him in the eye with a pencil
state of shock, he made a yell, i said, now what you want traitor
co puts me in the bin, i see ya about a month later
back in population, didn't matter that his friends tensed
the phone prints, the years added to the sentence
still chilling and all of that and i escaped
when the damn thing sold, don't hit the sto' cause they made a rape attempt
thank goodness, failed, call out next, he wail out
here go the co, ricky walters, back up, bailed out
the co couldn't see the rape, the kid'll snitch mass figure
fast trigger, you'll be back, you little bitch ass nigga
au revare, back to dating sluts and stars
at least for now, no more accumulating cuts and scars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars
behind bars...
