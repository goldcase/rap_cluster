"i'm the king, i'm the king, i'm the king" -

cuz when i appear wit hoes off a chair wit
stare wit, i'm talkin bout a party over here wit
main wreckon, girls be checkin, could be neckin
to respect and to remember every one of y'all a second to
relaxin, gonna be fraction, affraction, attraction

giggle to and as you can see a butt wiggle to
fried and spin my bride and move your hide in
nuttin but a jammy on my side and
so cling on brother's arm i'm thin

shit you will fist and cheer to dear, disappear,
to where you no where near to
and could never dream, run horse for debra and
clever trap a hook and screamin on yours forever and
town to town wit the b-boys sounds
that has the ruler rick announce, which ammounts to bounce to
classin, still hum the lassin, smash jewelry have like
kids from the bassin, cuz bodies lay about
respect you better pay about
obey about, cuz ricky isin't sweatin what you say about
hum on the clause, silent jay younger boy
rap bein strong, cuz see this is violence ya hunger for
so cling those on them cling, i'm wonderin
should i begin to kick ya mind to ching, cuz i'm king

let nobody clone ya, and get what i own ya
so hoes cling, those aren't i'm thin
i'm wonderin should i bring to kick ya mind to ching
cuz i'm king
