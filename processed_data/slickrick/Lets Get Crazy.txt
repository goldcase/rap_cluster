"let's get crazy"
get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get, get, get, get (let's get crazy!)
get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
well it's me, and it's time to mingle
so wake up world and bus' out my new single
i take dead bodies and i boost them up live
so straighten up and be alert because the ruler's arrived
no {not uncle sam} but i can still recruit
as {hip-hop commander} of the people's troop
so troop be troopers and follow commands
cuz' {no one can rule like the ruler rick can}
though some like it hot and some may like the shock
so let's get together what i mean is rock
no vanity, insanity {strictly cloud}
now put your hands together and scream and shout
{go slick rick!} and then go bizerk
but {keep it at a limit so no one gets hurt}
and don't be boring please not lazy
my jam's packed so let's get crazy
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get, get, get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get, get, get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get, get, get, get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
the original, that's the title i've earned
anybody disagreeing been burnt' and learnt'
told a theif straighten up as i humble hell
and i {bring a little rhythm} wherever i dwell
cuz' the door's wide open and i'm taking a chance
as i dip through europe and i'm going to (france)
now i always may try and play like full of fun
but in this type of rap i number one
not number (two) on a wild-style blizzard
and if i was in the oz i'd be (slick rick the wizzard)
or some yound man named mc ricky d
and no fool can say they created me
so wild child, lets go bizerk
but keep it at a limit so no one gets hurt
and don't freeload cuz' i'm not lazy
my jam's packed so let's get crazy
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
oh my god!
oh my god!
oh my god!
excuse me doug e. fresh (yes)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
well we're in the last station of the final chapter
{oh ricky don't go} but you know that i have to
so tell me daily news and all the magazines
(ricky d's in control) of what? (hip-hop scene)
uptown downtown the man's rated supreme
if martin luther were here he'd say (hey rick i had a dream)
and if i'm at a jam it must be pumping
people dwell us light cuz' it's them i'm stomping
so y'all be adventurous (shake and twist)
i insist that this will bring more than just bliss
a posse's and crewies' (is the size you best)
it's time to get (stupid), what i mean is (fresh)
hey wild child lets go bizerk
but keep it at a limit so no one gets hurt
and don't be a crumb and try to phase me
my jam's stacked so lets get crazy
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
get a lil' stupid (let's get crazy!)
