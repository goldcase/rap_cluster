"teenage love" lyrics
slick rick lyrics
"teenage love"
a teenage love, a teenage love
don't, don't hurt me again
aye sport, here's a thought from the old school crew
a serious situation we all go through
it deals with your feelins, so hear what i say
it's like a dyke, but nothing seems to go your way
bust this, two people, they really like each other
he says there's no one else
and she claims there is no other
the feelins are same, and you receive a notion
to reveal your inner thoughts deeply hidden 'motions
precious times, hopin they won't end
tell your mother bout your lover
also your best friend
ya mighty proud while your holdin their hand
boys, yo that's my woman, and girls, yeah that's my man
this person brings a certain warmth to ya heart
and everything seems so great at the start
for she loves him, and he also loves her
and it's hard to turn back to who the person you were
but later on, problems start to occur
and the bond which combines y'all turn into a blur
for the feelins were the same, now here's the score
you love'em to much, and they don't love you anymore
due to your attitude, another
or because they're not bein true
or maybe they're just plain sick of seein you
word, now it might seem strange
you better take his quick, and make the right change
see just when you swore, the ball was rollin'
they're gone, and part of ya heart's been stolen
get back on your feet, with a hop and a skip
but no, you rather go with this dead relationship
hangin around, and buyin'em stuff
you seem'em every darn day, yet don't see'em enough
you follow them around, and they claim ya hawkin
when conversation comes, you do all the talkin
not to mention, attention, we all need a bit
behind ya back they're sayin, yeah he's all on my tits
they're gettin sick of you, and quite annoyed
and if you had plans for the future, they're now destroyed
you saw what was happenin, and you still let it
and if you ever let him make love to ya girl, you can forget it
sweetheart, you been caught, it'll spread around town
faster then ya thought
and break up time, and your receive the words
yo this is from the heart, and i know the part hearts
get over it, from now don't take short slick
if it's not true love, you shouldn't deal with it
just think of your future, and what is to come
and pay attention to the words that's in this song, they go
don't hurt me again
don't, don't, don't hurt me again
do you know, where ya goin to
do you like the things that life is showin you
where are you going to
do you...
