"almost haunted"
(feat. taylor swift)
i stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
they call me slim roethlisberger
i go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
a merk her with a mossberg
i'm pissed off get murdered
like someone took a ketchup squirter
squirted a frankfurter
for a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
when you saw the chainsaw get to waving
like a terrible towel
i faced her around
but his fangs come out
get your brains blown out
that's what i call blowing your mind
when i come back
like nut on your spine
i'm a thumb tack
that you slept on son
now here i come screaming attack like i just stepped on one
low on the totem till he showed 'em
defiance, giant scrotum
he don't owe them bitches shit
his bridges, he out grow'd em
come on, come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on, come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breath whenever you gone
can't turn back now, i'm haunted
i'm back for revenge
i lost a battle that ain't happening again
i'm at your throat like strep
i step, strapped with a pen
metaphors wrote on my hand,
someone distorted my mint
read some i wrote on a napkin
i do what i have to to win
pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
not even austin powers, how the fuck are they mike meyers
and tell that psycho to pass the torch
to the whack before i take a shit in his jack-o-lantern
and smash it on his porch
now get off my dick
dick's too short a word for my dick
get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick
you call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
i just blew up the challenger, matter fact i need a lawyer
i displaced my clause with enough plaster
to make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
you're the eminem backwards, you're mini-me
see he's in a whole nother weight class
he smokes your bb's you beat back bullets
you're full of it; you were just in his cd's
left at infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
no peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
his new slim shady ep's got the attention of the mighty d. r. e
i'm haunted i'm dead your gone
come on, come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
won't finish what you started
come on, come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breath whenever you gone
can't go back, i'm haunted
oooooh
you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
never ever thought i'd see it break.
never thought i'd see it
