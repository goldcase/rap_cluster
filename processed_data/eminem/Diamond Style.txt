"diamond style"
(feat. 50 cent & 2pac)
sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
mind full of demons, i don't wanna hear them anymore
got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
so they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
smoking weed, can all make a change
so i'm told, but i haven't seen the change unfold,
i keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
communities in need of people that will lead
keep your eyes open, i can only say i'll try
until the day i die
niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile, was a problem child
try to put me in the courts but my force was wild
bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style,
these niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile, was a problem child
try to put me in the courts but my force was wild
bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
i could be wrong but i never got along with cops
putting money on my head
go on and get your refund motherfucker, i ain't dead i'm the diamond in the dirt,
that ain't been found i'm the underground king and
i ain't been crowned when i rhyme, something special happen every time
i'm the greatest, something like
ali in his prime
i walk the block with the bundles i've been knocked on the humble
swing the ox when i rumble show your ass what my gun do
got a temper nigga, go ahead, lose your head
turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
i walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
till i bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over
if it wasn't for rain joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain
niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile, was a problem child
try to put me in the courts but my force was wild
bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style,
these niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile, was a problem child
try to put me in the courts but my force was wild
bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
i could be wrong but i never got along with cops
let's pretend marshall mathers never picked up a pen
let's pretend things would have been no different
pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin they could blow away with the wind
marshall, you're never gonna make it makes no sense to play the game there ain't no way that you'll win
pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
and it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changing again
he wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
he had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
fuck a talent show in a gymnasium, bitch, you won't amount to shit quit daydreaming kid
you need to get your cranium checked you thinking like an alien and just ain't realistic
now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed it
and his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap olympics
slept through his plane and he missed it
he's gon' have a hard time explaining to hailie and lainie these food stamps and this wic shit
cause he never risked shit he hoped and he wished it but it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even here
he pretends that
