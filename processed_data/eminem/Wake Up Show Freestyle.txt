"wake up show freestyle" lyrics
eminem lyrics
"wake up show freestyle"
yo, speed racer, 97' burgundy blazer
wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury tracer
i'm on some low ish,
i'm fed up wit the being broke ish
i'm not to joke wit
bitch, i don't sell crack, i smoke it
my brains dusted; i'm disgusted at all my habits
too many asprin tablets and empty medicine cabinets
loosing battles to wack rappers 'cause i'm always too blunted
walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' like, "who want it?"
thug and crook; every drug in the book i've done it
my 9's at your frame,is that your chain? run it
who wants to die of an overdose of excessive flavor?
aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your progressive pager
spectacular, battle rap manufacturer
stole your mom's acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her
( right right right ! ! ! ) (( ding ! ! ! ))
the doctors you'll need after our battle are known as psychiatrics
i'll tell the nurses to hold a bed for you,
and i'ma make sure you come back for it
so barricade your infants, put up some extra fences
a woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses ( ooh )
..take em' on long vacation trips
kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships
mess up your face and lips
slit your stomach and watch your gut split
gut you wit that razor that i use to shave my nuts wit ((laughter))
mama don't you cry, your son's too far gone
i'm so high, i don't even know what label i'm on
i'm messed up, feelin' like an over worked plumber
i'm sick of the crap, what's dr. kevorkian's phone number? ( ha.. hot )
