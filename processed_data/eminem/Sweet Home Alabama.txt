"sweet home alabama"
well jimmy moved in with his mother
cos he ain't go no place to go
and now i'm right back in the gutter
with a garbage bag that's full of clothes
cause you live at home in a trailer
what the hell you gonna do (yee-hah!)
cause i live at home in a trailer
mom i'm coming home to you
well my name is jimmy
he's name's greg buehl
me and him and you, - we went to the same school
this ain't cool... i'm in a rage
he's tapping my mom and we're almost the same age
on the microphone i drop bombs
look at this car... 'thanks a lot, mom!'
"here and happy birthday rabbit! here's a brand new car, you can have it. a 1928 delta..."
this shit won't even get me to the shelter
and i can't even say i'm from mowtown
cause i'm back in the 810 now
cos i live at home in a trailer
mom i'm coming home to you
