"ridaz"
aww man…
yeah…
you ever be in the club man…
you get in a fight and people you don’t even know jump in
you feel like you wanna hit something your fist clinches
your pissed you just wanna get someone
well shit jump on this your bout to get your shit pushed in
i’m just inches away i’m splittin your shit wide open
no stitches can save you’ll die with your eyes open
you hope this isn’t the way you end up going out
but i guess just is i’m afraid razors siccors and blades
make jason say isn’t this great aww look theres participatin’
this ass kickin’ debate that’s startin’ to take place in the middle of street
little did you know there’d be an all out brawl soon as you heard this beat
emergancy personel rush to the murder scene but it’s to late
it’s absolute pandamonium rushed away in an abulance is your fate
nothing nobody told you when you left your house today
could of made you anticipate such an ass whoopin’
okay till the anger dissipates you get punched in the face reciprocate
so what the deal ridaz
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts
my balls are feeling mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull ‘em through my britches
i said so what the deal ridaz
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts
my balls are feeling might big now
i might just have to dig down and pull ‘em through my britches
you step in a place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
anxious to get in some shit got your gangsters all with your ladies
you better go get your mase cause shady said so
you may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
that’s a fucking lighter you feel now do you still wanna grill
if you don’t wanna get your shit beat outta you chill
cause if you doubt me you will yeah got me a pill found me a thrill
i gotta a couple of drinks here and i’m bound to refill
girl howdy how do you feel ma this cock sucker did not spill my drink
aww hell naw he must be tryna kill my buzz i will not budge
so what the deal ridaz
now here they all come and they got your back in like two seconds flat
and that’s probably a record yeah you wasn’t expectin that
cause they weren’t an army yet there’s a cognac bottle
we snuck it in cause they beer they was servin’ here was only tapped
i’m biting i fight dirty you might get kicked in the nuts
you fightin’ like this guy might hurt me your quiet certain he’s nuts
i’ve hit myself in the face harder play smarter
you may start a roll or you need a chainsaw to
dig your way out of go powder your nose pussy
the louder you yell the more i slap the shit outta you ho’s
you said it all faggots so now how do you ‘spose
we settle it hit me in the nose and see how it goes
so what the deal ridaz
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts
my balls are feeling mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull ‘em through my britches
i said so what the deal ridaz
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts
my balls are feeling might big now
i might just have to dig down and pull ‘em through my britches
it’s sheer hustle i bob weave deflate your beer muscles
we are tussled and the crowd startin’ to cheer us on
adrenalin’s rushin through us just like a gieser gushing
to much budwieser in my blood
i’m strangling you we fight for nothing
my signatures look are your marks look at you all big with your remarks
as i swing an ice pick at your heart
at least that’s what it feels like when i pick you apart
and dig at ya and break ya down like the bitch that you are
the predicament starts when i throw a brick at your car
the pain inflicted upon you is so sick as bizarre
shit this is almost ridiculous gape that is far
as having me want to rip out your fricken ligaments ahhh
you hit like a bitch you scratch me with your nails
for that you catch an open hand slap like a female
like bap in fact i’ll have the crowd smacking you themselves
where’s d12 i don’t feel like doing this myself
so what the deal ridaz
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts
my balls are feeling mighty big now
i might just have to dig down and pull ‘em through my britches
i said so what the deal ridaz
would you excuse me while i feel my nuts
my balls are feeling might big now
i might just have to dig down and pull ‘em through my britches
yeah…
what the deal…
i’m feeling hard as hell right now homie…
i almost feel…
invincible and shit…
ay dre!!
you got me feeling like…
i can’t be trouched right now foo…
i’m unstoppable…
damn…
