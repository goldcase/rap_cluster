"legacy"
tell me where to go, tell me what to do
i'll be right there for you
tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
i'll say it all for you
i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
why am i so differently wired? am i a martian?
what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in?
'cause i don't belong in this world
that's why i'm scoffing at authority, defiant often
flying off at the handle at my mom, no dad
so i am non-compliant at home, at school i'm just shy and awkward
and i don't need no goddamn psychologist
tryna diagnose why i have all these underlying problems
thinking he can try and solve them
i'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
and in the front drive talking to myself
either that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet
trying not to be noticed 'cause i'm crying and sobbing
i had a bad day at school so i ain't talking
some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
'cause he said that i eyeballed him
and if you fall, i'll get you there
i'll be your savior from all the wars that are fought
inside your world
please have faith in my words
'cause this is my legacy, legacy, eh
this is my legacy, legacy, eh
there's no guarantee,
it's not up to me,
we can only see
this is my legacy, legacy
legacy, legacy
i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
why am i so differently wired in my noggin?
'cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'cause i obsess on everything in my mind small shit
bothers me but not my father, he said sayonara then split
but i don't give a shit i'm fine long as
there's batteries in my walkman nothing's the matter with me
shit look on the bright side at least i ain't walking
i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a ten speed which i've acquired parts that i
find in the garbage, a frame, then put tires on it
headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
but if this is all there is for me life offers
why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
what about them rhymes i've been jottin'
they're kinda giving me confidence
instead of tryna escape through my comics,
why don't i just blast a little something like onyx
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
say what i wanna say to the kid that said that i eyeballed him
grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
who would've knew from the moment i turned the mic on that
i could be iconic, and my conquest
is word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest
this is my legacy, legacy, eh
this is my legacy, legacy, eh
there's no guarantee,
it's not up to me,
we can only see
this is my legacy, legacy
legacy, legacy
i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
now i think the fact that i'm differently wired's awesome
'cause if i wasn't i wouldn't be able to work
words like this and connect lines like crosswords
and use my enemy's words as strength
to try and draw from, and get inspired off em
'cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit
by you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
now you shut up bitch, i am talking
thought i was full of horseshit and now
you fucking worship the ground in which i am walking
me against the world so what? i'm brian dawkins
versus the whole 0 and 16 lions offense
so bring on the giants falcons and miami dolphins
it's the body bag game bitch i'm supplying coffins
'cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of brian baldingers
you gon' die a ball licker i've been diabolical
with this dialogue since 99 rawkus
you don't respect the legacy i leave behind y'all can
suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
in a flying saucer full of italian sausage
the most high exalting and i ain't halting
till i die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
the best part about me is i am not you
i'm me and i'm the fire marshall and this is my
legacy, legacy, eh
this is my legacy, legacy, eh
there's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
this is my legacy, legacy
legacy, legacy
