"w.e.g.o. (interlude)"
(feat. proof & dj head)
yeah soul intent, checking it number one baby this week
you know what i'm sayin'?
this is mc proof
and dj head
checkin' in on w.e.g.o.
you know what i'm sayin'?
ay yo we got the number one requested song, of the day coming up next.
it's a local thing wants retilin'
it goes by the name of eminem
and it's called "it's ok"
