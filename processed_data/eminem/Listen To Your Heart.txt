"listen to your heart" lyrics
eminem lyrics
"listen to your heart"
i know there’s something in the wake of your smile
i get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
we’ve built a love but that love falls apart
a little piece of heaven turns to dark
listen to your heart
there's a certain mystique when i speak,
that you notice that it's sorta unique,
cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep,
and i'm still matic the way i flow to this beat,
you can't sit still, it's like tryin to smoke crack
and go to sleep, i'm strapped,
just knowing any minute i could snap,
i'm the equivalent of what would happen if bush rapped,
i bully these rappers so bad lyrically,
it ain't even funny, i ain't even hungry,
it ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
for you to play me, it's cockamamie,
you just ain't zany enough to rock with shady,
my noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo,
i got screws loose, yeahhh, the whole kitten-kaboodle,
i'm just brutal. it's no rumor, i'm numero uno, assume it,
there's no humor in it no more, you know
i'm rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag,
you need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
there used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme and
wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
but now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in it
the shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
it's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rapping
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happening
me and dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it, he wasn't going to go after him
until ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed him
fuck it, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have it
meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that i'll be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing?
i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up
and stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
i'll never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying
cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in
either kept getting broken into and robbed
or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
