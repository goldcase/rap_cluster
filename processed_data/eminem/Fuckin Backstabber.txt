"fuckin' backstabber"
(performed by soul intent)
(feat. proof)
"fuck it, friends or no friends i had enough bullshit to last me clear to the end"
i shoulda been able to see that you were the one behind this
but i was blind as fuck to think that you weren't the kind that stuck some more in the spine this
it was as if our friendship broke in half
and watch you turn everything into a game and joke and laugh
and both of us know we can't discuss the situation
like adults each confrontation just results in accusations and insults
so i'ma just let it go for now
and leave you be, it's over now
what goes around comes back around
believe you me, lay low for now, come here you fuckin'
come here you fuckin' backstabber
why i oughta, beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you fuckin' backstabber
why i oughta, beat a nigga that's up to no good, haha
why don't you take a second to stop and think about what you done
and you want to call that being a friend, that isn't what you want
all because of what you run your mouth, you wanna prance around and gloat?
let's see how well you dance around when i got my hands around your throat
cause it's a matter of time till i get my blows in and it won't be long
you shouldn't go walkin' around and stickin' your nose in where it don't belong
cause every time you talked when you was stretchin the truth
theres gonna be one more flyin' knuckle you're gonna catch in the tooth
come here, come here you fuckin'
come here you lil double-crossing goin behind my back snitcher
good for nothin but trouble causin instigating fact switcher
you were the least that i suspected
till the puzzle fell into place with every piece that i selected
but i'll never let that crap happen again
you come back blabbin' again
catch it smack dab in the chin
that's for backstabbin a friend
cause every name in the book
wouldn't be enough
so i just figured i'd say your name in the hook
check it out, come here you fuckin
backstabbers don't live too long
around my way friendships betrayed
in the hood you die for that!
for those that don't love this combat and verbally say this
this could relate to the death of a backstabber
thats like the desire to make total discombobulation and combustion of the neck
the backstabber for the female, you skeezin' ass bitch nigga!
so remember, the backstabber always loses in the end
a friend is a friend to the end
f-r-i for fri, e-n-d a friend for the end..yes
to eternity..the backstabber shall never flourish
take em out...
