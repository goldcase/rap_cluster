"thru the fire"
(feat. j. cole)
i am going up
i am going all the way through the fire
i get up and go higher
so please don’t bring me down
and nothing is gonna bring me down
i am going all the way thru the fire
i will get up and then go higher
so please don’t knock me down
and nothing is gonna knock me down
now i ain’t got no kids yet,
but this one here is for practice
i hate to get the seats in benz wet.
but that’s how good your ass is.
make an old man get his glasses.
make wesley pay his taxes
then follow ur moves all weak on twitter
probably make a gay nigga consider.
you rocking now with the best mayne. (man)
dress game down to the sex game
won’t brag but the boy has been blessed with the blessed mayne
let you play with the stick ovechkayne.
she’s calling, she’s texting
she’s falling but let me explain
gotta tell your old boyfriend
skate girl
cauz a nigga don’t play them ex games.
no! straight sexing
no handcuffs or arresting
and i ain’t coming off my last name.
cauz i really can’t take no stressing
bout where i done been
who i done hit
your home girl saying
he’s a bad boy
bout where i done been
who i done hit
your home girl saying
he’s a bad boy
she said
i heard you got a main chick
a mistress and some hoes
you be up to no good
and every body knows
i can’t get enough of what you got
good god
you hit the spot
tried to let go but i just could not
so don’t you stop i need that
hey globetrotter,
cole hotter
either way
out in london town
hoes holla cauz they love my sound
and i got love for the underground.
kweli pimp c hot town
where bun gets down
met a bad bitch
that’ll cut all night
that’ll suck all night
you just, cut off lights
never fuss or fight
almost missed my flight
tryna give my last girl a nut
all right?
she be down for whatever
whenever i wanna get up in the guts
all right?
on the grynd tryna find
this lettuce
i love it when you give me head
i hate it when you give me headaches
i am going up
i am going all the way through the fire
i get up and go higher
so please don’t bring me down
and nothing is gonna bring me down
i am going all the way thru the fire
i will get up and still get higher
so please don’t knock me down
and nothing is gonna knock me down
nobody asked for life to deal us
with these bullshit hands we are dealt
we have to take these cards ourselves
and flip them. don’t expect no help
now i could have
either just
sat on my ass
and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which i am placed in
and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid
to wait by the door and pack his bags
who sat on the posch hoped and prayed
for a dad to show who never did
i just wanted to fit in
at every single place
every school i went
i dreamed of being that cool kid
even if it means acting stupid
aunt edna always told me
keep making
that face it’ll get stuck like that
meanwhile i am just standing
there holding
my tongue tryna talk like this
till i stuck my tongue
on that
frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
i learned my lesson then
cauz i wasn’t tryna impress my friends no more
but i already told you my whole life story
not just based on my description
cauz where you see it from where you are sitting
its probably 110% different
i guess we would have to walk a mile
in each others shoes
at least
what size you wear??
i wear tens
let’s see if you can fit your feet
i am going up
i am going all the way through the fire
i get up and go higher
so please don’t bring me down
and nothing is gonna bring me down
i am going all the way thru the fire
i will get up and then go higher
so please don’t knock me down
and nothing is gonna knock me down
