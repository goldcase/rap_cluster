"you don't know"
(feat. 50 cent, lloyd banks, ca$his)
yeah...
who run it?
you know, you acting like you don't know
we run it
you know but you acting like you don't know
who run it?
you know, you acting like you don't know
we run it
you know but you acting like you don't know
you know, you acting like you don't know
i tear the club up fo' sho'
this flow is gon' bring mo dough
and you know but you acting like you don't know
now homie i say i run it (run it) cause i'm in control
hypnotic, hennessey, a couple shots of patron
i have you feeling aight, i get you high as a kite
party popping shawty says she coming with me tonight
i ain't shoulder leaning, i ain't snapping and popping
either i'm bobbin ma head or i'm just standing their watching
i'm a hustler i hustle, you can tell that i'm paid
and i protect what i got, i'm in the house with my blade
nigga you front you gone get it, ok now maybe i said it
cause i want you to triddy, yeah i be on that shitty
you should see when i'm stunting, i flash the stones to be wanting
push the whip, see me rolling, you can tell that i'm holding
i'm just doing ma thang, you know the units the game
i got my grimy shady with me you front you gonna have to get me off your ass
i pay the lawsuit and laugh (haha)
it's not a big deal it's nothing but some cash (let's go)
who run it?
you know, you acting like you don't know
i tear the club up fo' sho'
this flow is gon' bring mo dough
and you know but you acting like you don't know
who run it?
you know, you acting like you don't know
i tear the club up fo' sho'
this flow is gon' bring mo dough
and you know but you acting like you don't know
when me and fif got together to do this music
the more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
it's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemesis is su nemesis
ain't for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
but this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
when there's beef you jus' gotta know when to butt in and butt out
if there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
it usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
and wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
and let it go to whoever's holding the most current beef on their shoulders
and their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
but tonight, we ain't coming here to beef with nobody
we came to party, banks, cashis and mr. ferrari
so it's shady aftermizat back in that ass, you wizzass
come hizzon what kinda fuzukin quizition is that
who run it?
you know, you acting like you don't know
i tear the club up fo' sho'
this flow is gon' bring mo dough
and you know but you acting like you don't know
who run it?
i say you know, you acting like you don't know
i tear the club up fo' sho'
this flow is gon' bring mo dough
and you know but you acting like you don't know
pistol play ricochet, see where the victim lay
slumped over bleeding j.f.k
hays k to your chest plate cave
i ride to the death, do you rep that way?
forever ima be a shady 7-4 gangsta
plus i survive everything you got in that chamber
i thrive off of danger, jumping in all beef
you keep talking shit now the squad called me
enough holding back the steam, em let off a magazine
dappadon cappa queen mixed in with cashis creams
started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell i'm a fucking g
i'm on automatic when i'm at it, start static
and you splattered, shit shattered, i'm a walking bitch magnet
spit it how i live it, live it all the way to the limit
and i'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?
who run it?
you know, you acting like you don't know
i tear the club up fo sho
this flow is gon' bring mo dough
and you know but you acting like you don't know
who run it?
you know, you acting like you don't know
i tear the club up fo sho
this flow is gon' bring mo dough
and you know but you acting like you don't know
who run it?
you know who this is
shady, g-unit, aftermath
lloyd bands, cashis, marshall mathers, ferrari f-50
it's a movement, you can't stop it
talk of new york, tony yayo...
