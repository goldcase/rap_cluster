"the people's champ (intro)"
i told the world one day i would pay it back
say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day i could play it back
they ask me am i okay, they ask me if i'm happy
are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
this is a beat with no words at first, it’s a blank painting
exercising the mind, it’s brain strength training
my motto is live by the bottle
so why is my supply low? bring in a truckload with a high-low
my name is chauncey billups, i'm kind of like a raunchy phillips
screwdriver, my crew's live when you can't sleep and you're still up
i came in this game with, bad intentions
and i ain't budged, not even an inch since then
lava on my lips i flips, wake up think i have a cramp
i'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
i'm gonna step up on this stage now, i'm gonna strut
shady man, i done told you once homie to easy up
but you just won’t listen will ya? nah, i guess not
