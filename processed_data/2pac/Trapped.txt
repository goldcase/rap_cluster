"trapped"
you know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do
to me
cause they never talk peace in tha black community
all we know is violence, do tha job in silence
walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
niggas commin' out worse offthan when they went in
over tha years i done alot of growin' up
getten drunk thrown' up
cuffed up
then i said i had enough
there must be another route, way out
to money and fame, i changed my name
and played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i gettem
i'll hittem with tha bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'g'
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
they got me trapped....
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
they got me trapped
(naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
trapped
(naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
they got me trapped
can barely walk tha city streets
without a cop harrassing me, searching me
then asking my identity
hands up, throw me up against tha wall
didn't do a thing at all
i'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
coppers try to kill me
but they didn't know this was tha wrong street
bang bang, down another casualty
but it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
who do you blame?
it's a shame because tha mans slain
he got caught in tha chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
sweated me, hunted me
trapped in my own community
one day i'm gonna bust
blow up on this society
why did ya lie to me ?
i couldn't find a trace of equality
work me like a slave while they laid back
homie don't play that
it's time i lett'em suffer tha payback
i'm tryin to avoid physical contact
i can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
they got me trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
you know they got me trapped
(naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
you know they got me trapped
(naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
now i'm trapped and want to find a getaway
all i need is a 'g' and somewhere safe to stay
can't use tha phone
cause i'm sure someone is tappin in
did it before
ain't scared to use my gat again
i look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
but now he's tha devils friend
too late to be tellin' him
he shot first and i'll be damned if i run away
homie is done away i should of put my gun away
i wasn't thinkin' all i heard was tha ridicule
girlies was laughin', tup sayin "damn homies is dissin you"
i fired my weapon
started steppin' in tha hurricane
i got shot so i dropped
feelin' a burst of pain
got to my feet
couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley
still lookin' for my getaway
coppers said freeze, or you'll be dead today
trapped in a corner
dark and i couldn't see tha light
thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
what do i do ?
live my life in a prison cell
i'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
they got me trapped
(naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
you know they got me trapped
(naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
trapped
