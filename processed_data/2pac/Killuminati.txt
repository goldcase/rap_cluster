"killuminati"
let it be prophesized; ni**az'll die because ya crew's goon
around the way ni**az get murdered by the full moon
heard it in whispered tones
ni**az is bold and they choose to roll
i kill em all, watch now ni**a truth be told
westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
ni**az dyin by my 30-yard, brains'll splatter
wonder why these ni**az cross me
i'm certified crazy, so sick the world made me
now diggy-die, everytime i ride it's for reasons
hard to kill a ni**a cause i'm comin back like jesus
bow down to my ill nation runnin from drug cases
lookin at my congregation so full of thug faces
momma gave a ni**a breath, a life of stress
i invest in a vest and makin ni**az watch they every step
label me a threat
and i ain't even got started with this s**t yet
thug style baby, hands on my pistol, listen i'm a ridah
every ni**a breathin pay attention
bout to show you motherf**kers how it feel, to drop a body
the simple gun to my lifestyle, killuminati
yo makaveli they can't stop you
hold it down
killuminati and we got you, got you
yo makaveli they can't stop you
hold it down
killuminati and we got you, got you
yo makaveli they can't stop you
hold it down
killuminati and we got you, got you
yo makaveli they can't stop you
hold it down
killuminati and we got you, got you
after the fire comes the rain, after pleasure there's pain
even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin again
til i make it yo; my military be prepared for them bustaz
similar to, bi**hes that scary, get too near me we rushin
visions of over-packed prisons, fiends and ni**az thug livin
pressures and three strikes, i hope they don't test us
they pull the heater ammunition it cranks, psssh
move without a sound, as we slide down, pistols in place
they got me fiendin for currency, the money be callin
it's like i'm - dreamin, see in season me ballin
participated in felonious behavior
cock the cocked fo'-five, snatchin ni**az pagers
labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
we started out drinkin 40's, moved to harder s**t
god damn now i'm a grown man, i follow no man
ni**a got my own plan, and it's called killuminati
i spend most of my time bankin ni**az
because they hate a ni**a, comin across fake ni**az
but we made ni**az, old school and i'm thinkin
y'all some bi**h made ni**az and you steadily sinkin
o-u-t, l-a-w-z ain't nuttin f**kin with that
we bustin back comin back for the stacks
laugh last cash cash, all i want is the paper
givin them f**kers tool whips, i rule haters
y'all can't fade us, we kill steal and peal quickly
the boss ni**az, definitely, put it down strictly
e.d.i. amin, until the law come for me
kill em all for shortie, ninety-nine killuminati
they got me thinkin strugglin and hustling's my only fate
toppin grams on the kichen plate, tryin to keep that money straight
times is rollin three up these streets sleep
but when i crack, hammer cocked back rapped in my sheets
my life's been crossed, crooked since a seed it hurts
got a package from the devil, payin my deeds
preocuppied by the greed, in this crooked life i lead
more funds to spend, or bigger guns to squeeze
me and my thugs clock g's simpin naughty thangs
real as these tatt's on my body, and it's killuminati
makaveli the don until i'm gone, i maintain
hold it down, hold it down
makaveli up in this bi**h, worldwide mash, westside
makaveli the don until i'm gone, i maintain
the question we ask, do you know what time it is?
hold it down, hold it down
you know what type of s**t we be
makaveli the don until i'm gone, i maintain
you want that hip-hop real
it's that hip-hop that's real
hold it down, hold it down
hip-hop that's worldwide, feel?
makaveli the don until i'm gone, i maintain
f**k with me ni**a you get killed!
hold it down, hold it down
it don't get no realer than this
makaveli the don until i'm gone, i maintain
what's my motherf**kin name ni**a?
hold it down, hold it down
my ni**az we all bad
makaveli the don until i'm gone, i maintain
what's my muh'f**kin name ni**a?
hold it down, hold it down
what's my muh'f**kin name?
makaveli the don until i'm gone, i maintain

rap pro at his finest
makaveli the don until i'm gone, i maintain

ni**a, you know what time it is
makaveli the don until i'm gone, i maintain..
outlawz..
