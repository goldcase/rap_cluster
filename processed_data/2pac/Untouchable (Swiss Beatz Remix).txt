(feat. krayzie bone)
am i wrong cause i wanna get it on till i die?
am i wrong cause i wanna get it on till i die?
get it on till i die

it's that tupac (pac)
it's that tupac (tupac)
(pac's home)
ha ha
after the fire comes the rain
after the pleasure there's pain
even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
time to make ya'll, my military be prepared for the busters similar to
bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em
visions of over packed prisons
million's of niggas thug living
pressure's, three strikes i hope they don't test us
so pull the heat out, ammunition in crate's (shh)
move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
i'm sensing niggas is defenceless i'm hitting fence's then getting ghost
who can prevent me shooting senseless?
at these niggas throats
bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
outlaws busting while we rushing
we untouchable
fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
we outlaws rushing you busting you
we untouchable
it's that tupac (pac)
(am i wrong cause i wanna get it on till i die?)
it's that tupac (tupac)
(am i wrong cause i wanna get it on till i die?)
it's that tupac (pac)
(get it on till i die)
it's that tupac (tupac)
(get it on till i die)
it's that tupac (pac)
(y'all, y'all remember me)
it's that tupac (tupac)
(y'all, y'all remember me)
you niggas better not try to run up
and don't try to say we ain't told you
you're dealing with killers and soldiers
nigga these explosives, trying to blow shit, running you over
nigga controller
whenever y'all niggas try to roll up
thinking i'm a ho, well, come and let me show ya
i'm a light up the rhythm like dosia
dumping so potent, nigga don't choke up
flow up
makaveli the don, got niggas strapped and ready to bomb
as soon as i send the alarm, and when we're done
we've committed a red rum, leaving the enemies dead and gone
leaving 'em niggas head's blown, cause they know they dead wrong
when the shots ring out you know we're coming through (know we're coming through)
talk a lot with your mouth, well what you gon' do? (so what you gon' do?)
shut 'em down, busters be knowing to keep they distance
thugs don't fuck around
we get back at 'em so swiftly, niggas is with me underground
slug in a niggas mug, reppin' midwest side
niggas if you a thug get your weapon, let's ride
ride for pac, pac, get live for pac, pac, pop off the glock, glock
the thugging it don't stop
it's that tupac (pac)
(am i wrong cause i wanna get it on till i die?)
it's that tupac (tupac)
(am i wrong cause i wanna get it on till i die?)
it's that tupac (pac)
(get it on till i die)
it's that tupac (tupac)
(get it on till i die)
it's that tupac (pac)
(y'all, y'all remember me)
it's that tupac (tupac)
(y'all, y'all remember me)
only wish to breed
i explode into a million seeds
ya'll remember me
legendary live eternally
bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
niggas screaming peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em
take them to places, stake they face then erase 'em and brake 'em
murder motherfucker's at a rate and then quicken the pace
blast me but never ask me to live a lie
am i wrong cause i wanna get it on till i die?
(westcoast)
now i'm worldwide
niggas gossip like girls then hide
no offence to nas but this whole fucking world is mine
even if you blind you can still see my prophecy
my destiny to overthrow those on top of me
fiending for currency the money be calling
can you feel me, dreaming?
seeing scenes of me balling?
fuck you bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
outlaws busting while we rushing
we untouchable
fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
we outlaws rushing you busting you
we untouchable
