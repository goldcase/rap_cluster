"there u go"
(feat. outlawz & big syke)
there you go.....acting like a hoe....
(i don't know why i'll be fucking with you)
was it the liqour
that makes me act blind?
the times i'm with her
anonymous pictures
of other niggas trying to kiss her
will i love her, or shall i dis her
i'm sick of this scandalous shit i deal with
trying to paint a perfect picture!
my memories of jealousy no longer care free....
'cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep telling me
i'm on tour but now my bedrooms an open door
so it got me thinking what am i trying for?
when i was young i was so very dumb
eager to please a little trick on a mission trying 2 get 'em up p
me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers!
we don't love bitches!, and believe they don't love niggas!
i got 'em plain by attraction
but you became a distraction a threat to my paper stacking
i thought you'd change, but now i know
can't turn a hoe into a house wife baby
and there you go...
there you there you go, acting like a hoe
there you there you go, acting like a hoe!
there you there you go, acting like a hoe
acting like a hoe, acting like a hoe!
see the word on the streets your
just a groopy on a world tour
now i find out for myself your
girl you need to check yourself...
you need to check this, i got this game twisted
so i don't claim 'em, just bang 'em...
papa raised a player, so player i'll play 'em
i got hoez, that got more hoez than me
so how i love getting hooked like i ain't got g
truly, cutie, booty babe!
but that ain't enough
and the head make me bag, still that just ain't enough
when i don't trust her, bitch be lien too much
she be dieing to fuck me, you be buying the stuff...
see old friend i know.
