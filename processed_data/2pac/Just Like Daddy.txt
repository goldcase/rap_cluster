"just like daddy"
outlawz (go ahead), in this
makaveli the don up in this
no doubt, death row / makaveli records
you can call me daddy
ugh - i'll be ya daddy
that's right
just like daddy
for tha ladies
come with me and in time we'll grow
dedicating slow jams on the radio...i --
know you're happy i can feel the passion
lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
sunshine turns to rain
baby i can take away your pain
if you trust me
close your eyes and feel the magic
never leave when you need me
i'll do you just like daddy
i met her when she was young
her real daddy died when she was younger
her moms let her do what she pleased
and seen no one loved her
her eyes shinin' love
a diamond in the rough
the kind that you can love
not yet touched with so much...
potential
youngster let me guide your mental
into a place
where the sourness of pain you'll never taste
by god's grace
you was born with that face
nothin' but pure beauty
so for an eternity i feel it's my duty
to be your souljah
yeah baby got plans to mold ya
in the coldest nights is when i hold ya
like i'm supposed ta
as we grow closer
i'll take your hand gladly
anything you need ask me
spoil my baby girl just like daddy
to alleviate the stress, spendin' time with you
i feel blessed
when you gone, feel a pain so strong -
deep in my chest
when i got arrested
came so close to goin' to jail
throwin' blows at the po-po's
breakin' your nails
screamin' loud, goin' all out
damn, i dig
you stay locked down at mom's house
watchin' the kids
through the whole bid
in the v-i
i see ya daily
when my fake homies try to fuck you
you run and tell me
that's why i stay committed
i thank god every time i hit it
hopin' you'll forgive me for the times i've bullshitted
me and you against the world
we untouchable
screamin' like you're dyin' every time i'm fuckin' you
you never had a father or a family
but i'll be there
no need to fear
so much insanity
and through the years
i know you gave me your heart, and plus
when i'm dirt broke and fucked up
you still love me
come with me and in time we'll grow
dedicating slow jams on the radio...i --
know you're happy i can feel your passion
lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
sunshine turns to rain
baby i can take away your pain
if you trust me
close your eyes and feel tha magic
never leave when ya need me
i'll do ya just like daddy
boo would ya - die for me?
down - holdin' my pistol
gettin high' with me
sounds tougher than bristle
but when you cry
i'll be your tissue
back in the county
writing letters how i miss you
givin' you credit
apologetic
"how i diss you?"
'cause you for thinkin' like a minor
ain't on the level of this old timer
daddy ready to wine ya and dine ya
lace you from toe to platania
and still
be right behind ya - truth
like just me and you no tellin what we could do
gettin' high between the sheets
make this shit right here discrete
puttin' hickies on ya belly while we fuckin on the beach
i love it when ya nut up and grab me
i feel for ya badly, baby girl just like daddy
shorty i lend my hand out to help ya
lost soul lookin' for shelter
on the late night accept ya
treat ya good won't disrespect ya
my age is young
out of place bitch
callin' days is done
from a tricksy to a missy
you know i raised ya hon'
placed her under my wing
showed her how we swing
now she rollin' blunts for her king
one day labeled thug misses
the essence of my ghetto sistas
hugs and kisses
destined for me to be a father figure
come with me and in time we'll grow
dedicating slow jams on the radio...i --
know you're happy i can feel your passion
lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
sunshine turns to rain
baby i can take away your pain
if you trust me
close your eyes and feel the magic
never leave when you need me
i'll do ya just like daddy
where my sistas?
where my sistas at?
where my sistas?
where my sistas at?
throw ya hands in the air
where my sistas?
where my sistas at?
where my sistas?
where my sistas at?
