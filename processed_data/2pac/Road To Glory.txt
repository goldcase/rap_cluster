"road to glory" lyrics
2pac lyrics
"road to glory"
my road to glory is filled with thorns
fluent thoughts from my brain and i train to remain strong
they said i couldn't do it
lock me in chains til i
my struggles closer to the pain of a trained killer
please believe that i'll never be shamed again
again i'll be the next heavyweight champion
call me crazy but no one can fade me
i'm the product of the projects
lost and crazy
throw your hands up mr. bruno, why?
big mike tyson 'bout to brutalize that ass tonight
no hesitation in front of the whole nation
i beat that ass so bad i probably violate probation
through demonstration as i strategize information
intend to kill so it's real like i'm catching cases
ha-ha
let the world know i plan to die
if i don't leave with what i came for i'll be denied
now, my first round is for the times that i spent in this cell
the second round is for the media and the lies they tell
my third round is for the pain that i felt inside
best recognize i won't be denied, when we ride
my first round is for the times that i spent in this cell
the second round is for the media and the lies they tell
my third round is for the pain that i felt inside
best recognize i won't be denied, when we ride
