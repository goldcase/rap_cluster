"until the end of time"
(feat. rl (next))
perhaps i was addicted to the dark side
somewhere inside my childhood witnessed  my heart die
and even though we both came from the same places
the money and the fame made us all change places
how could it be through the misery that came to pass
the hard times make a true friend afraid to ask, for currency
but you could run to me when you need me, i'll never leave
i just needed someone to believe in, as you can see
it's a small thing through and true
what could i do? real homies help ya get through,
and coming new, he'd do the same thing if he could
cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
and half the time we be acting up call the cops
bringing the cease to the peace that was on my block
it never stop, when my mama ask me will i change
i tell her yeah, but it's clear i'll always be the same
until the end of time
so take, these broken wings
i need your hands to come and heal me once again
(until the end of time)
so i can fly away, until the end of time
until the end of time
until the end of time
please lord forgive me for my life of sin
my hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
so you know i don't hang around the house much
this all night money making got me outta touch, shit
ain't flashed a smile in a long while
an unexpected birth worst of the ghetto child
my attitude got me walking solo
ride out alone in my low-low
watching the whole world move in slow-mo
for quiet times disappear listen to the ocean
smoking ports think my thoughts
then it's back to coasting
who can i trust in this cold world
my phony homey had a baby by my own girl
but i ain't tripping i'm a player i ain't sweating him
i sexed his sister, had her mumbling like a mexican
his next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen
besides rapping the only thing i did good was scrapping
until the end of time
now who's to say if i was right or wrong?
to live my life as an outlaw all along
remain strong in this planet full of player haters
they conversate but death row full of demonstrators
and in the end drinking hennessy made all my enemies envy me
so cold when i flow eliminating easily
fall to their knees, they plead for their right to breathe
while begging me to keep the peace (ha ha)
well i can see close into achieve
in times of danger don't freeze time to be a g
follow my lead i supply everything you need
an ounce of game and the training to make a g
remember me, as an outcast outlaw
another album out that's what i'm about, more
getting raw till the day i see my casket
buried as a g while the whole world remembers me
until the end of time
if an angel comes down
and takes me away
the memories of me
and my songs
will always stay
till they can find
(until the end of time)
until the end of time
till the end of time
