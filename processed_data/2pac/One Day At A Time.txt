"one day at a time"
(feat. eminem, outlawz)
sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
mind full of demons, i don't wanna hear them anymore
got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
so they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
smoking weed, can all make a change
so i'm told, but i haven't seen the change unfold,
i keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
communities in need of people that will lead
keep your eyes open, i can only say i'll try
until the day i die, i promise to be wise
with my heart open, greed, brings only misery
a way to tragedy, so i stay sucker free
only a few chosen, rise (rise)
my ghetto queen, rise (rise)
don't be afraid to try (try)
too many of us died to the door to open wide
my brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
though everybody dies
we can...
only learn to take, our anger and our hate
control our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight
maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
for we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate
cause by then its too just late, theres so much we can take
theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
to the point that he just breaks, snaps and thats all it takes
you'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
but we aint
its plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays
and a picture that he paints
but in the midst of all this anger and this angst
never once did you hear me say i'm a gangster and i aint hear no complaints
but i know, that i will always continue to grow,
as long as i lead and never follow no one else's shadow
there will never be another me
and that i can guarantee
thats why the fuck i remain sucker free to this day
the game will never be the same
no matter how much fame or success they attain
there will never be another me
and no matter what they do
there will never be another you
you can search but you'll never find
you can try to rewind time
but in your hearts and your minds
we will never die
we are forever alive
and we continue growing....
one day at a time
don't be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
rappers are regular people minus money and light
searching for fortune and fame, and super stardom
all the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest.
now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching
and kids think beef is the only option
outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
my memories of khaddafi, but makaveli lives on
you think the industry is fun
and no pity with guns
and when your money is up
thats when your enemies come
so if he died and came back
would he try to save rap?
we needing a change, the drama remains
i spent my whole life, fighting myself
that i cant win so i'm inviting some help
and every now and then i take rights from left
im still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt
and that there is a fight in itself
so i just pray and hope god
take a like to myself
no matter how much i try (stay alive)
i'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride
heard frivolous beats, we past that
i'm trying to keep some income coming in
and collect on my ass cap
the rappers in the game aint changed
and i finally realized that we not in the same game
the hating will never end, so i guess i'll deal wit it
them 4-5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
the streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
as they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
so we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling
one way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
and we continue growin...
...one day at a time. damn!
