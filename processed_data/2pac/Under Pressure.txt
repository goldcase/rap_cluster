"under pressure"
under pressure
yeah, babyyy
when tha pressures on...
when it's on it's on
one of these days i'll
learn
don't fuck with trick ass niggas
cause they
turn into bitch ass niggas
i'm sick of bein stuck in tha county jail
my niggas clown
bring a pound
when they posten bail
smokein' blunts in tha driveway
my four-five screamin
fuck tha police
won't fly away, thug, till i die
you wonder why i'm made this way
i wasn't
turned out
i was raised this way
of thinkin
these are tha dreams of a young teen
sceam, and stack green on tha crack fiends
one time can't hold me
one of these days
we gotta bust back for tha homies
locked down in tha penitentry
finaly loose my mind
if tha pigs succeed
stress, smoken weed and nicoteen
but what a nigga really need is thorozine
right before i die
i'll be curseing tha law
reincarnated bitch even worse than before
my four-four's givin payback
my underhanded plan
to get them niggas while they laid back
and big stretch hit tha scene with tha mini 14
servin suckers like dope fiends
and lead tha whole team
under pressure nigga
that's right
never run
throw your gun in tha air
oh yeah
nigga bust ain't no time to spare
called tha ruffest mothafucker and we fuck shit up
and with tha stainless steel , we cut shit up
flash and blast a nigga with tha quickness
cock tha four pound motherfucker when i spit this and rip this
damn, my mind is in tha depths of hell
but when i'm walking on tha street kid my name rings bells
and i never fell
nigga i stand to tall
i'm just a thug motherfucker who was born to brawl
givin my all
so niggas wanna bring it to me
so i'ma sell my cocain
and lay they ass down 'g'
under pressure
yeah, look here tho
runnin wild
i never smiled as a juvenile
even now i keep a frown when i come around
don't ask me about tha past
it was all bad
shots blasted
will i last
in tha wrong path
in tha dark is where my heart saw tha most grief
mothafuckers is getten shanked over gold teeth
am i sick ?
cause i'm addicted to get splifted
watch tha stupid ass tricks get lifted
nothens changed
cause in tha came it's a steady aim
fuck friends
cause when in danger those niggas change
puff weed
and stuff g's in my sock g
call ki's and hennessy where tha glock be
times passen will i last here another day
i put my gun away
and grab my ak
it's getten hectic
i can't call it
house full of alcoholics
now we're niggas under pressure
yeah, that's right...
under pressure, we're niggas under pressure
yeah
when tha pressures on it's a hit
ski mask
extra gats
bring tha clips
don't nobody move when we walk tha streets
they stay silent
cause talk is cheap
