"solar midnite" lyrics
lupe fiasco lyrics
"solar midnite"
a simplified love sick,
taking no prisoners,
sunny day, cold heart,
listen up listeners,
darkside love affair,
out of time, and in a rush,
you can't help me 'til the sunrise lifts up.
let's levitate up the horizon,
i can see it in your eyes,
everythin' you're hidin'
i can see the truth in you,
even when you're lyin'
even through the darkness,
i can see you shinin'
well it's midnight, and it's colder,
pull you closer, i can see you through.
when it's sunshine, and it's solar,
and it's over, guess it's me and you.
blood. (blood) by. (by) sun. (sun) light. (light)
a played out love song,
playin' in the background
seems to describe every part of where we're at now.
every feeling we ever had for each other,
ever karaoke love letter, lyrics undiscovered.
now your mother used to tell me you ain't nothin' but some trouble,
now it's couple trouble makers,
making mayhem on the double,
tryna figure out the meanin' and break apart the puzzles,
why they love you, when i hate you,
when they hate the way i love you.
(solar.)
well it's midnight, and it's colder,
pull you closer, i can see you through.
when it's sunshine, and it's solar,
and it's over, guess it's me and you.
well it's midnight, and it's colder,
pull you closer, i can see you through.
when it's sunshine, and it's solar,
and it's over, guess it's me and you.
blood. (blood) by. (by) sun. (sun) light. (light)
a complicated heartbreak,
losing it's direction,
cold day, warm heart,
object of affection,
my darkside, love affair,
come to my protection,
midnight's on the way,
i'm losing my connection.
let's levitate over the horizon,
i can see it in your eyes,
everythin' you're hidin'
i can see the truth in you,
even when you're lyin'
even through the darkness,
i wanna see you shinin'
well it's midnight, and it's colder,
pull you closer, i can see you through.
when it's sunshine, and it's solar,
and it's over, guess it's me and you.
well it's midnight, and it's colder,
pull you closer, i can see you through.
when it's sunshine, and it's solar,
and it's over, guess it's me and you.
well it's midnight, and it's colder,
pull you closer, i can see you through.
when it's sunshine, and it's solar,
and it's over, guess it's me and you.
well it's midnight, and it's colder,
pull you closer, i can see you through.
when it's sunshine, and it's solar,
and it's over, guess it's me and you.
