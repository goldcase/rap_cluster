lupe fiasco lyrics
"hood now (outro)"
this one for the hood!
what do you do when it's so unequal?
wear michael jordan's with your tuxedos
it's hood now
it's hood now
yea, yea
it's "hood" now
public school system only teaching parts
so the school of hard knocks is what make you street smart
you're hood now
hood now
yea, yea
hood now
open fire hydrant 'front the liquor store
kool and perm ads all on the billboards
you in the hood now
you in the hood now
that's right
you in the hood now
ramen noodle soups, you make the best
water in the milk to make it stretch
that's the hood now
that's the hood now
that's the hood now
that's the hood now
ivy league was running really well then
they slipped up and let cornel in
it's hood now
it's hood now
yes it is
it's hood now
in miami beach, it's rich white folks
but memorial day, "you know who" do the most
it's hood now
it's hood now
it's hood now
yea, it's hood now
and house shoes is for the house fool
the homies wear 'em out, how cool
it's hood now
it's hood now
that's hood now
oh yea, that's hood now
and that mercedes benz, on them giant rims
open up the trunk and see 'bout twenty ten's
that's hood now
it's hood now
that's hood now
oh yea, that's hood now
and diamond chains was for kings and queens
but since we got to 'em they'll never be the same
they hood now
they hood now
bling, bling
it's hood now
you pissed her off, you broke the rules
her earrings out, she taking off her shoes
it's hood now
it's hood now
it's about to be...
really hood now
chop up jazz, loop up the rock
sample the blues, call it hip-hop
it's hood now
it's hood now
yea mayne
it's hood now
we took that hurt, made it into songs
god bless the child that's got his own
sayin' it's hood now
sayin' it's hood now
pants saggin' right off my ass
i sit it down, right in first class
it's hood now
it's hood now
yes sir
it's hood now
fancy restaurant, dress code
t-shirt, gym shorts
it's hood now
it's hood now
hallelujah
it's hood now
fashion shows, with fancy clothes
you see mr. west right in the front row
it's hood now
it's hood now
that's what it means
it's hood now
at the oscar's, p on the sticks
and the winner is… three-6
it's hood now
it's hood now
uh oh…
it's hood now
we took that hurt, made it into songs
god bless the child that's got his own
sayin' it's hood now
sayin' it's hood now
you had elvis presley and he was crackin'
but guess what? here comes michael jackson
it's hood now

that's right
it's hood now
pro sports, them was yo' courts
but you let us in, so on and so forth
it's hood now
it's hood now

they gave us scraps, some of it old
we cooked it up and called it "soul"
it's good now

and you know me, i don't vote
but the white house, you already know
it's hood now

we took that hurt, made it into songs
god bless the child that's got his own
sayin' it's hood now

one for the ghetto
