"adoration of the magi"
(feat. crystal torres)
you're so smart
you're like, a contemporary museum of art
that farts, that's harsh
narcissism, on narcotics
on sharp objects in large pockets
at dark, you ain't gotta hide it
keep it, metal gear solid
lead the leaders, that's how you file it
then clobber it
low on energy, find peach cobbler then gobble it
yeah, it's food in them drums and boxes
if you beat 'em up then they'll drop it
and they'll rapidly flicker till they disappear
blinking gradually quickens till they isn't here
and that's da da da da da da da...
just to be back in
reincarnated, exact twin
exact ten, exact twelve
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba...
exact self
do i really gotta say it?
didn't we all play it?
dojo, abobo
overshore the throat, polo
billy, jimmy
even on the low low
why you ready to die? you just a baby
why them tears up under your eyes? you just a baby
keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby
quit chasing money, never mind, you just a baby
(these maji adore you)
why you wanna be born again? you just a baby
why you playing in the streets? you just a baby
now let's vogue, martin pose
downward facing dog, warrior pose
tree pose, bridge pose
triangle pose, seated twist (pose, pose)
upward facing dog (pose, pose)
pigeon pose
in this bitch, that's vulgar, that's yoga
let's try it again with clothes
and closer, enclosure, exposures
quiet is kept like rosicrucian meet koza nostras on oprah's sofa
with both controllers
watchin' gazans and ashkenazis ride roller coasters
say yeah
yeah, lots of options, now up is down, two player
now a is jump and b is punch
you seein' somethin' that weren't there
to find friendliness in a nemesis, it's a old test
3 buttons, see somethin'
that's emphasis on genesis
can't be eyes closed when you side scroll
you not the first person
the first person from your first cursin'
to your first cursive
and your curse words is in the curve version
it occurs virgin is the word version
that refers perfect to the first person
in the third verse, who's really me
in the third person but prefers the first one, that's me
again
master cleanse and a syringe
from a gerber until your first burger
pamper to her depends
everything between is just drawers
even in between is no loss
even where the king is no boss
meet it with a swing it's so south
unless you bamm bamm
knocking them pitches into the grand stands
in the club, watching the women just do them hand stands
like you a man's man
that's washing down a ham with the zam zam
who got a baby in here with these strippers?
she's two weeks pregnant
didn't even know, he's dancing with her, damn...
