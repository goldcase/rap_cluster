"thank you" lyrics
lupe fiasco lyrics
"thank you"
i'm just a wolf inside a lion's suit
a shark shirt, a panther's pants, piranha hat and tiger shoes
i got a lion's den inside the booth
that right there is point blank
this here is from where the sniper shoot
might take a long time to get it, by the time i hit it
i done ran bubble tape around them chiclets, poof
i ain't the bomb, i'm the company that got the contract
to rebuild during the aftermath - have a blast
going green only using half the gas
the calming comes through after disasters have
but this calm has the same fury that disasters have
i should have a class, i'm the son/sun of the south pole plus alaska's dad
got niggas like "dag!!", flow is like crazy gone mad
and villains gone bad, punk ass niggas, don't be so daft
baby, why you hanging with them busters like babs?
they are such a drag, you should move them to the trash
feel like i'm walking round upon cassius calves
quite a beautiful script, and such a gift of gab
a big bass, shout out to mistah f.a.b
young frankenstein reporting live from the lab
i bought the bars out, put it on my tab
if you came here to box, you'll leave in a bag
i run the game, bilderberg group, in the lead with the flash
usain bolt ain't even leaving this fast
why you take offense with your defensive ass?
never hussein-ing the hole/whole, not even in the half
cause nigga i ain't hiding, i'm the whole world, nigga you're an island
and the sea's rising, if i keep shining
you going have to take submarines to the drive-in now
