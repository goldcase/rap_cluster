lupe fiasco lyrics
"lamborghini angels"
it's a mad world out here, i tell you
the world's gone stark, raving mad
everyone in the world is mad
it's a mad crazy world
i see diamond-flooded demons
lamborghini angels
lamborghini angels
lamborghini angels
halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
with a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure
pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword
writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door
just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord
listen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause
a seduction of his senses by the devils he adores
the unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war
follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward
shun him while in public disallow him from your stores
have no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours
make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores
but we must still pray that his color will be cured
with her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain
he looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains
how she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged
her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became
from the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims
to do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane
you must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain
you torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame
blank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name
perfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints
may god bless the scientific cure for the insane
knew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change
with his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine
put his bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind
told him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine
now the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time
with no life inside his body now he finally think he's safe
but they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face
he take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states
now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped
with the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens
doesn't mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins
he forgives them in advance says that he will do again
my fellow americans...
