"break the chain"
(feat. eric turner & sway)
i waited all my life to play
i still can't find a way
but if i work it one more day
i might just break the chain
i might just break the chain
i might just break the chain
freedom, we can use some of that especially where we from
where we grew up like a green thumb
it's like a criminal is the only thing you can become
look at what i became
something like a phenom, nothin' but a g-thang
things i've seen when i'm looking out of these frames
pictures i painted on the walls where we hang
from the trees we hung
strange fruit man look at how we swung
how the hell you gonna tell us something
we ain't have a father
how to try to grow up and be one
see umm feel it in my bones
that i'm sittin on a throne
like a killer with a chrome
when i spit another poem
shed a whole lot of light on a little bit of home
super swatter, the kid remains but i represent
i ain't no paper planes. i'm fly
plus, i don't write no more, sorta from the top
i'll show you razor stay sharp
but i knew how to razor blade
i've paid my dues and now i wait for change
because the flows so rude
it goes without asking lupe
i'm so big, you aim to break
quick to cut off any baggage like some samurai, i like to travel light
i've gotta leave you at home delilah, this is samsonite
no case for the police
said i have seen killah's, i aint never seen 'em
ghostface, only thing i'm watchin' is my panerai
i've got an alibi, i was taking pics of chicago call me camera chi(shy)
chain broke, pick up nicorete for your chain smoke
no cigarettes on my plane, yo
stunt your ham bones from the game's throat
put it on mine, take a long time
b-a-barock is how i'm livin' online
on a webisode like let's go let 'em know
that i put up the footage that i'm takin' your shine
wanna see the real chain look in your mind
your brain look like your lil wayne brotha
overgrow, overload, broken zone
niggas playing games in the hood they got you stuck-up
playa thinkin' that its cool to be a pimp still
we gon' set it free like a fish in a pimp hill
take this home, rearrange it, change it
danger, sway-zer, lupe laser. pow!
