"hurt me soul" lyrics
lupe fiasco lyrics
"hurt me soul"
now i ain't tryna be the greatest
i used to hate hip-hop... yup, because the women degraded
but too $hort made me laugh, like a hypocrite i played it
a hypocrite i stated, though i only recited half
omittin the word "bitch," cursin i wouldn't say it
me and dog couldn't relate, til a bitch i dated
forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
but i learnt it from a song i heard and sorta liked
yeah, for the icin, glamorized drug dealin was appealin
but the block club kept it from in front of our buildin
gangsta rap-based filmings became the buildin blocks
for children with leakin ceilings catchin drippins with pots
coupled with compositions from pac, nas's "it was written"
in the mix with my realities and feelings
living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom and artistic vision
i began to jot, tap the world and listen, it drop
my mom can't feed me, my boyfriend beats me
i have sex for money, the hood don't love me
the cops wanna kill me, this nonsense built me
and i got noooo place to gooo
they bomb my village, they call us killers
took me off they welfare, can't afford they health care
my teacher won't teach me, my master beats me
and it huuurts meee soooul
i had a ghetto boy bop, a jay-z boycott
'cause he said that he never prayed to god, he prayed to gotti
i'm thinkin godly, god guard me from the ungodly
but by my 30th watchin of "streets is watchin"
i was back to givin props again and that was botherin
by this uncomfortable as a untouchable touchin you
the theme songs that niggas hustle to seem wrong but these songs was comin true
and it was all becoming cool
i found a condom on the ground that johns would cum into and thought
what constitutes a prostitute is the pursuit of profit then they drop it
the homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
it seems i was seein the same scene adopted
prevalent in different things with the witnesses indifferent to stop it
they said don't knock it, mind ya business
his business isn't mine and that nigga pimpin got it
they took my daughter, we ain't got no water
i can't get hired, they cross on fire
we all got suspended, i just got sentenced
so i got noooo place to gooo
they threw down my gang sign, i ain't got no hang time
they talk about my sneakers, poisoned our leader
my father ain't seen me, turn off my tv
'cause it huuurts meee soooul
so through the grim reaper sickle sharpening
macintosh marketing
oil field augering
brazilian adolescent disarmament
israeli occupation
islamic martyrdom, precise
yeah, laser guided targeting
oil for food, water, and terrorist organization harborin
sand camouflage army men
ccf sponsorin, world conquerin, telephone monitorin
louis vuitton modelin, pornographic actress honorin
string theory ponderin, bullimic vomitin
catholic priest fondlin, pre-emptive bombin and osama and no bombin them
they breakin in my car again, deforestation and overloggin and
hennessy and hypnotic swallowin, hydroponic coughin and
all the world's ills, sittin on chrome 24-inch wheels, like that
they say i'm infected, this is why i injected
i had it aborted, we got deported
my laptop got spyware, they say that i can't lie here
but i got noooo place to gooo
i can't stop eatin, my best friend's leavin
my pastor touched me, i love this country
i lost my earpiece, i hope y'all hear me
'cause it huuurts meee soooul
