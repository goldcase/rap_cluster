lupe fiasco lyrics
"they.resurrect.over.new"
(feat. ab-soul & troi)
dark matter with the sparks scattered up above
velvet hands in the upper glove, touch
like bad double dutch
and two amsterdam's ain't enough, d.r.u.g.s;
"don't ruin us, god said", #drogas
too much pride we electric slide, we should be closer
like soda, nothin' changed but a chola
i see the sun then the clouds then the vultures
pay respects in my sensei's sculpture
high as the angel on the dikembe's shoulder
eyes looking like mkultra
we deck the vision through these dark shades
bad dreams through the screens of an arcade
hangin' on the joy like the residues of heartbreak
park full of art, arteries full of parquet
'bedient like new games, easily defeating
or two gangs meeting for the evening
or two feet on a riesling, slow wind
meditate to the slow mind
decorate me with shine till i go blind
bdsm dominated it with no bind
safe word is don't stop, both or don't go no times
proceed to the next level
(tron)
proceed to the next level
(tron)
coolest, tulips, flowers, fall from the towers
like galls from galileo to lay low
ignorance that the world isn't ours, the god
give them all showers
toni found the fountain of youth, in the mountain of power
to only find truth in the fountain, drowning in power
surrounded with dollars
the moon surrounds us like spoons moving chowder
cut, that's a mis-direct to stir the soul with dis-effect
names don't last like mr. x
unless you galilee dropping bowling balls on the discotheque
with a disco ball hanging 'round your neck
dance, it's a new year
every time i open my hands
thoughts moving circles and the thoughts universal
yokozuna's don't throw salt in a circle
sumo you up off off your turf boy
tsunami you up off your surfboard
medusa in the go
'fore versace turned words into turquoise
medusa turned coke into stone
with a hand on her thigh, she looked me in the eye and said
proceed to the next level
sounds so far, seems so much
(tron)
i cannot settle for good enough
so i'll sweat and i'll climb until i reach my prime
(proceed to the next level)
the forces rise and fall again
throw it up, will i reach the end
in my eyes, there's a fire and it takes me high
uh
soulo!
shoot for the moon, even if you miss you'll be among the stars (space)
backstroke in my pool of thought but don't mind the sharks (wavy)
ab-solar system intergalactic soldier
lupe say i'ma stoner, i say that i'm much bolder
trapped in a game where the trap is the game
scope this horror, aquarius's make it rain here
no love for your honor, only god can judge us
if you're islamic, allah, i've had enough to my collar
with these niggas castin' stones like this mancala
proceed to the next level, dig that with a platinum shovel
black magic, matter of fact, if matter is fact
a matter factory is in the making perhaps
uh, erase your database
we race against time, no time to set a date
tattuo and youth induced
too cool for school, unloose the noose and
with
next level, next floor
i'm ready for it
i've been waiting all my life
tron, tron
we're going up, we're going up
next level, next floor
