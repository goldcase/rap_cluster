"dumb it down"
(feat. gemstones, graham burris)
i'm fearless
now hear this
i'm earless
and i'm peerless
that means i'm eyeless
which means i'm tearless
which means my iris resides where my ears is
which means i'm blinded
but i'm gonna find it i can feel it's nearness
but i'm gonna veer so i don't come near
like a chicken or a deer
but i remember i'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear
here, you steer, i really shouldn't be behind this, clearly cause my blindness
the windshield is minstrel, the whole grill is roadkill, so trill and so sincere. yeah, i'm
both them there
took both pills, when a bloke in a trench coat and the locs in the chair had approached him
here
and he clear as a ghost, so a biter of the throats in the mirror
the writer of the quotes for the ghosts who supplier of the notes to the living
riveting is rosy, pockets full of posies, given to the mother of the deceased. awaken at war,
'til i'm restin' in peace
you goin' over niggas' heads lu (dumb it down)
they tellin' me that they don't feel you (dumb it down)
we ain't graduate from school nigga (dumb it down)
them big words ain't cool nigga (dumb it down)
yeah i heard mean and vicious nigga (dumb it down)
make a song for the bitches nigga (dumb it down)
we don't care about the weather nigga (dumb it down)
you'll sell more records if you (dumb it down)
and i'm mouthless
which means i'm soundless
now as far as the hearing, i've found it
it was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is
but the doorknockers on the ear of a stewardess in a lear
she fine and she flying, i feel i'm flying by'em 'cause my mind's on cloud nine and i'm a mime
at the same time
pimps c the wings on the underground king
who's also klingon
to infinity and beyond
something really stinks, but i sphinx like leon
or lying in the desert
i'm flying on pegasus you're flying on the pheasant
rider of the white powder, picker of the fire flowers, spit hot fire like dylon on chappelle's
skit
yeah, smell it on my unicorn, snort the white horse, but toot my own horn (sleep)
you've been shedding too much light lu (dumb it down)
you make'em wanna do right lu (dumb it down)
they're getting self-esteem lu (dumb it down)
these girls are trying to be queens lu (dumb it down)
they're trying to graduate from school lu (dumb it down)
they're starting to think that smart is cool lu (dumb it down)
they're trying to get up out the hood lu (dumb it down)
i'll tell you what you should do (dumb it down)
and i'm brainless
which means i'm headless
like ichabod crane is
or foreplay-less sex is
which makes me stainless
with no neck left to hang the chain with
which makes me necklace-less
like a necklace theft
and i ain't used my headrest yet
they said they need proof like a vestless chest 'bout the best, fair f-f-jet in the nest
who exudes confidence and excess depth
even scuba steve would find it hard to breathe
around these leagues
my snorkle is a tuba, lu the ruler around these seas
westside poseidon, westside beside'em, chest high and rising
almost touching the knees of stewardess and the pilot
lucky they make it flowered
personal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves
david blaine
make it rain
make a boat
i make a plane
then, i pull the plug and i make it drain
until i feel like flowing and filling it up again..(westside)
you putting me to sleep nigga (dumb it down)
that's why you ain't popping in the streets nigga (dumb it down)
you ain't winning no awards nigga (dumb it down)
robots and skateboards nigga? (dumb it down)
gq man of the year g? (dumb it down)
shit ain't rocking over here b (dumb it down)
won't you talk about your cars nigga? (dumb it down)
what the fuck is goyard nigga (dumb it down)
make it rain for the chicks (dumb it down)
pour champagne on a bitch (dumb it down)
what the fuck is wrong with you? (dumb it down)
how can i get on a song with you? (dumb it down)
look b, here's my man, my two way, (hey) uh, what should i - ah here take this (hey) that
right there, fuck what my boys talking about nigga, (hey) nigga you hot to me, i like you (dumb
it down)
bishop g, they told me i should come down cousin, but i flatly refuse i ain't dumb down nothing
