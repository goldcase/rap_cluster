"welcome back chilly"
uh, before we get started in this
you know this thing right here
i gotta say
welcome home
to my main man chilly mac
yeah
before we get started in here
i'd like to tell the world that my partner is here
been on 23 and 1 for like 14 months (damn!)
that's the boss of first and fifteen is home chumps
thanks to god for removing the obstacle
thanks to craig for making it possible
million-dollar bond is what held us down
now who in the hell is gonna help them now
you see ck cuz that check you cut
you got a couple fools on your set, what up
see his mind is sharp and mine is art
refined and smart and it's time to start
while you was behind them bars i was behind these bars
rewind to when the police took our cars
but they don't know there's more where that came from
me and chilly mac back to backin' some
see the game ain't the same since you left out
see the snakes and the lames yeah they crept out
ooh you know we need ya
ooh i'm glad they freed ya
here is where we need ya
hey it's nice to see ya
welcome back welcome back welcome back chilly mac
welcome back welcome back chilly mac
welcome back welcome back welcome back chilly
welcome back welcome back welcome back
you ain't even gonna dwell in the past tense
i gotta say one love
to that boy sean carter for holdin the young nigga down
while you was absent
make sure my foot was good and my hand was pimp
and when them niggas jumped ship
a hand was limp
to try and turn the tide help withstand the stint
the time when it was hectic strictly on the strength
that's why we got moves to make
new records to record, new rules to break
we back standing on two the crew is straight
new and improved fnf crew you snakes
how they gon' stop us police still watch us but it's cool cuz you're home dog
no more visits on friday, no more commissary, no more collect phone calls
see the game ain't the same since you left out
see the snakes and the lames yeah they crept out
ooh you know we need ya
ooh i'm glad they freed ya
here is where we need ya
hey it's nice to see ya
welcome back welcome back welcome back chilly mac
welcome back welcome back chilly mac
welcome back welcome back chilly mac
welcome back welcome back welcome back
i'd like to welcome everybody out
to fahrenheit 1/15
first off
rip to my nigga kato
what up val
magic what up
my man k'naan
you know
the whole henchman crew holding us down
my man jigga
the whole chi-town mike love what up
and now
y'all about to see something
that y'all ain't never seen before
well
i don't wanna say never seen
but not like this you know what i'm sayin'?
fnf up!
