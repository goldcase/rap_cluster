lupe fiasco lyrics
"heat under the babyseat"
now little terry got a gun he got from the store
he bought it with the money he got it from his chores
he robbed the candy shop told her lay down on the floor
put the cookies in bag take the pennies out the drawer
little chalil got a gun he got from the rebels to kill the infidels and american devils
a bomb on his waist a mask on his face prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
little alex got a gun he took from his dad
that he snuck into school in his black book bag
his black nail polish black books and black hat
he gonna' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass
little joker got a gun he bought on the street
to go and kill the that beat him up last week
cause he don't let go of none of his past beefs
bullets flying out the window shells landing on the seats
little sarah got a gun from her uncle sam
she got armour piercing rounds and her gun don't jam
she got lasers got rockets
she killing to go to college
she thought it was an insurgent it was some old man
now you can get guns on the internet
ak's, glocks, nines, inatechs,
so when you see shorty don't disrespect
watch better tomorrow and play grand theft auto
get back
