lupe fiasco lyrics
"don't get it twisted"
"neeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrdd!"
westside, baby
what's good?
i'm only gonna do this once, man
once
till the album come
so, check it out
from the m-a...d-i to the s to the o-n
po'in, to getcha open
move like a nigga's supposed to get the dough
it'll go with the flow that i'm holdin'
joe'n'em, they ownin' up - up on enough
stay in the zone, that i go in
that i go in, when i go in and go in
of the po'ins, and the rope man
crucial conflict was smokin'
but a nigga like me, i don't be chokin'
so i proceed at low speed, low key
like a og in a '03 loc-in'
rollin', like a oz in a b-league
both pins, like a bowlin' ball when i ball
but i never fall for the oki-dokin'
white walls, with the slow-speed motion
stash-box for the police pokin'
rolie showin, shorty showin, hokey pokin'
turnin it around with me to bust em down cuz they know he golden
exactly
i'm in it from the minute i was in it till the minute
that i spit it and it's finished
and it's sad for me
until the second wind, and reinvent it with a vengeance
revisit and make 'em give it
back to me
all right, that's all you get
i'm done
you know what i'm sayin'?
and the streets where they traffic me
nigga what
