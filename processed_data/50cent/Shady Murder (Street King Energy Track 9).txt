"shady murder (street king energy track #9)"
ay yo fif’ i was thinking you should go back to doing the shit you used to do
murder them, murder them
they violate, i demonstrate
yeah, i’ll murder them
niggas be fronting word up
they stunting till they hurt up
that semi talk i’ll let it buck
i had these niggas running hard
i’ll pull a nigga’s skirt up and have him kicking dirt up
i’ll get a nigga an’ a nigga back up stupid hard
silence it’s the return of the tyrant
seein’ through my third eye with both closed eyelids
stand closer to the homie you gon’ to die with
flames come up out the muzzle wanting shit that i did
i’m talking like the feds ain’t listening
nigga this is a pool of piranhas you’re fishing in
i give to a nigga if he want it
better ask niggas about me i’ll be on it
i get to drop, blow out your knot, perfect planning
hit your back with something hot out the cannon
it’s murder one, it’s premeditated
murder, then it’s another one
back to back, put work in
it’s murder one, it’s premeditated
murder, then it’s another one
back to back, put work in
you know i ain’t got the strap on me
holding that for me
i’m fucked up, it really doesn’t matter though
hundred 9mm shells in the calico
wait, niggas drop like dominos
run for your life, puta si vámonos
i was taught to see my crew a long time ago
grew up around cocaine, yeah even my mamma know
i cut a o in the fo’ with seven at a time
made four hundred of that, you know a nigga grind
like cindy lauper bitch, time after time
a nigga shine like a nickel nine
i’ve been talking to the man in the mirror
nigga so ass they was shaking like shakira
it seems like my vision’s gettin’ clearer
see me coming with the hammer out, death is gettin near ya
it’s funny how niggas never hear ya, till you run down on ‘em
gun down on ‘em
it’s murder one, it’s premeditated
murder, then it’s another one
back to back, put work in
it’s murder one, it’s premeditated
murder, then it’s another one
back to back, put work in
yeah starting to feel like the old me (ha ha)
