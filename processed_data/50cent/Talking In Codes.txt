"talking in codes"
{"alright, are you ready?"}
fuck that
these niggaz is green, these niggaz is green
i'm talkin in codes, pardon me what i mean
when you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
catch him in a hoopty, squeeze hit him through the do'
these niggaz is green, these niggaz is green
i'm talkin in codes, pardon me what i mean
when you see him it's a go, go 'head nigga go
catch him on the front porch by his momma do'
these niggaz is green
it's nuttin to it, cock it, bang it and get rid of that
hit his fitted cap, he won't get a chance to twitter that
i make the ruger sing a song, bullets hum to you
you better have god wit'chu when i come to you
i'm a grimy nigga, i said some simple shit
you's a dirty nigga with syphilis on your dick
i catch you i'ma wash you up, line you, spit-shine you
leave you right there in the street, where niggaz can find you
die nigga die, fly pelican fly
when i pull it eat a bullet, don't question me why
what's the laws of the jungle, i'll show you what the gun do
my bad, what the shell do; you rot until they smell you
get green son get him, cut his head
he didn't even see it comin, he sleepin that's what he did
get biz, niggaz actin like it ain't what it is
let the knife work push the blade up in his shit
let doc come sew him up, gang signs throw 'em up
in my hood growin up - you pussy or you bout it
you shootin or you runnin, the police comin
niggaz get at you, you get at them or you don't mean nuttin
niggaz walk tough, even walk like warriors
on some g shit they get to singin like gloria
now come clean, tell us what you told the d's
matter fact don't tell us shit, motherfucker hold this
yeah, feels like summer to me
expect it nice and hot
40 day, my bad my bad
family day, i be in the projects
y'all come check me out
get a chance to do some new shit
you don't wanna miss this, trust me
