"build you up"
la la la la la la
ooh i'd lie for you baby
ooh i'd die for you baby
i build you up
but if ever i fall down
and i need you to pick me up
promise me you'll be around
hold me down
i'll build you up
listen if you let me, i'll be the reason you shine
its a secret i want the world to know that you're mine
but on some real shit, communications could be better
so i'm writin' a song, instead of a love letter
they can play it on the radio, a hundred times a day
i figure when you hear it, you would stop and think of me
i wanna get to know ya and be the reason you smile
girl, you know where i'm from, you know how i get down
when times are tough, tell me that i'm special
not rap, i mean me, that i'm special
you know they say diamonds are a girl's best friend
precious stones, could you put me before them
if so, i'll see to it that they always around
nothin' but the best now, how does that sound
if i drop a jewel when we talk you can keep it
girl, you on my mind all the time, its a secret
baby i'll build you up
girl if i, never show i have you by my side
i build you up
girl i need to know for sure you're mine
i need to know for sure
i think about you thinkin' that you feel the same way
was it just my imagionation again runnin' away
if you ready to ride girl come on let's roll
g-55 fly ma let's go
its hard to measure the pleasure of havin' you in my present
your smile makes me smile, i'll show you my style
we can shop a lil bit, i pick out my shit
one pair at a time, till your shoe games sick
now who knows what the future holds, we'll be together probably
for better or worst, like whitney and bobby
if you wanna play house, we can play house then
but wait why pretend if you can move in
before i be your buddy in bed, let me be your best friend
girl, its more than lust, i want your trust
you keep it real with me, i'll keep it real with you
cause i know with you by my side, there's nothin' i can't do
baby i'll build you up
girl if i, never show i have you by my side
i build you up
girl i need to know for sure you're mine
i need to know for sure
