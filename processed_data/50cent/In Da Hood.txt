"in da hood"
(feat. brooklyn)
i still be riding through the 'hood
brooklyn to compton, it's all good
from southside queens to inglewood
we representin' like we should
i'm hot boy, i told you before
got that benz and that hummer off the showroom floor
i know you hate it when i pop up, wrist all rocked up
in the 'hood, empty niggas locked up, they rats all knocked up
baby after baby, the 'hood is crazy
niggas'll set you up and wet you up, trust me they shady
got a pet bulldog, i keep under my linen
it don't bark, they spark when the revolver spinnin'
we winnin'
hold up, hold up, get a good look at my rims
god damn, look at them twenty-fours diamonds spin
now the d's, they harass me in the 'hood
a few times, niggas try to blast me in the 'hood
fuck it's all good
catch me in the coupe - on the lean
wit' needles and samples and diesels for the fiends
the money stay on my mind, so i stay on the grind
plus niggas like to stun, so i stay wit' my nine
i ain't the type nigga that be out, runnin' his mouth
talkin' gangsta and shit, with my gun in the house
now homie, you better get to know me better
before you be bleedin' pints of blood into iceberg sweater
when the tails come flyin' up out the beretta
you gon' feel like it's yo' fault and say "man i knew better"
look dogg, i don't play that shit
i pull that thing out i'ma spray that shit
that how i get down
brooklyn she's so sick in the hood
got these fat bitches get the spit in the hood
'cause i throw diamonds, shot that fifth in the hood
that's what you get for talkin' all that shit in the hood
yeah i'm still a minor, remember this
everything brooklyn choppy broads still behind ya
brooklyn to compton it's all good
get robbed, get shot, shit is poppin' in the hood
