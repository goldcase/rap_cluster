"got me a bottle"
we can do whatever it is you want that you want to do
long as i can spend the whole night with you
hennessy sippin' (got me a bottle)
bacardi drinkin' (got me a bottle)
smirnoff sippin' (got me a bottle)
absolut shorty (got me a bottle)
tangueray sippin' (got me a bottle)
absolut drinkin' (got me a bottle)
e&j sippin' (got me a bottle)
champaigne drinkin' (got me a bottle)
i'm gettin' tipsy off a bottle of bacardi
wit' a model at a party
i got kids, but mommy gon' be swallowin' pro'lly
see i always get my way girlfriend, i'm spoiled bad
keep my hydro stashed in a crown royal bag
your performance will determine the price
see if you fuckin' to champaigne, but if not it's smirnoff ice
and 9 times outta 10, i was pissy when i was with you
but they don't make a liquor strong enough for me kiss you, nah
i don't fuck wit' scurry ass niggas
that ain't got a care in the world
i'm fin' to drink this motherfucker right here till i hurl
admit it, i'm that motherfuckin' nigga you lovin'
new york nigga, soundin' like i'm straight up southern
what bitch, don't try to play me close to see what i'm drinkin'
yeah i'm rich, i ain't a trick, what the fuck are you thinkin'
i'm some type a nigga that ain't 'bout that money man
if i smack you in your face you get funny man
ha ha
