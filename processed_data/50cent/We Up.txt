"we up"
(feat. kendrick lamar & kidd kidd)
yeah, uh huh
i'm round the bullshit like a matador
i'm used to the bullshit, it don't matter, boy
corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth
build with the gods and double knowledge of self
entrepreneur visions, moulin rouge religion
that pussy make a weak nigga break down
so what you want, the cheese or the cheeks?
you want the cheeks but she want the cheese
a bitch gotta eat
i'm havin' the epiphany you niggas ain't shit to me
worse than the scum in the slum i'm from
i'm a southside nigga, yeah i'm 'bout mine
you be that next nigga corners come outline
you ain't made of what i'm made of
you a bum nigga with a bum bitch
who's shoes come from bakers
counterfeit, fraudulent fakers
what kind of rich nigga bitch look like that?
ya'll know when we pullin' off the lot
brake, hit the button, then we pullin' down the top
shine's on stuntin' and i'm pullin' out a knot
strapped with the glock, won't pull it out a lot but front, i'll make it pop
you don't do it how we do
niggas ain't own the shit we own
everything new
spikes on the louis vuittons (vuittons, vuittons)
we up, nigga
visualize everything i needed and dream (uh-huh)
penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme (what else?)
guns in your video get you locked in tha' bing
yeah, i kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean
murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up
charity work, parking tickets and no charges
fuck nigga you fucked over your father, when he gave you a dick should have been a bitch in pajamas
i made my first million fucking dollars
bought a bible, oh yeah, god got me
made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and binocular
i'm scared, this shit don't happens to everybody
i'm on instagram looking at your favorite singer
debating on should i fuck, or jump on her single
20 thou, she got a hell of a adlib
i'm in her mouth like i knew i could have kids, k-dot
ya'll know when we pullin' off the lot
brake, hit the button, then we pullin' down the top
shine's on stuntin' and i'm pullin' out a knot
strapped with the glock, won't pull it out a lot but front, i'll make it pop
you don't do it how we do
niggas ain't own the shit we own
everything new
spikes on the louis vuittons (vuittons, vuittons)
we up, nigga
'round the world tourin', the city got borin'
bury me a g with a new pair of jordans
coupe foreign, top peeled like an orange
blue ferrari, so many iron horses
living life with no worries
my gun got a zodiac sign, it's a taurus
don't make it slam on you like amar'e
m'zone, rida gang, end of story
oops that's your baby, my bad, i'm sorry
she call me daddy too, we should be on maury
everything you aren't, fly nigga soaring
purple label ralph lauren, kick game like atari
you so special, bedroom or restroom
just keep performing, go girl
about to film a movie, guess who it's starring?
(ahhh.)
ya'll know when we pullin' off the lot
brake, hit the button, then we pullin' down the top
shine's on stuntin', and i'm pullin' out a knot
strapped with the glock, won't pull it out a lot but front, i'll make it pop
you don't do it how we do
niggas ain't own the shit we own
everything new
spikes on the louis vuittons (vuittons, vuittons)
we up, nigga
good pussy for dinner or bomb kush for breakfast
d'd-deep-colored vs stones around my neck bitch
feels like a nigga dreamin' (dreamin'), feels like a nigga dreamin' (dreamin')
