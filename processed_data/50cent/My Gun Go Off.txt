"my gun go off"
nigga, my gun go off
you see the barrell turnin'
you feel the hollows burnin'
nigga now you learnin'
nigga, my gun go off
call it attempted murder
nigga i'm trying to merk you,
when i come back bustin'
nigga, my gun go off
don't try to say i'm trippin'
when i get to flippin'
then i smack the clip in,
nigga, my gun go off
we call it putting work in,
leaving niggas hurting,
homocide's learkin'
my gun go off
f**k boy you can see it to believe it
tryna dodge and wave it end up a parapelegic
believe me its easy
i'll hurt you, i'll merk you, i'll pop summin'
drop summin', i ain't gonna stop hunting
run run till you're spun
one shot one gun
one-9...
1-1 emergency,
it's murder, b
it's excellent execution when i'm pulling the trigger
no mistake for that cake
i'm hitting you and your niggas
feel the flame when i aim,
for the top of your brain
see the spark and the bang,
nigga shit ain't a game
do the math or get blast
bullets go through the glass
go through your ass fast
and the leather seat sitting ave.
its not a war when there's casualties on one side
i ride
turn it up on you niggas after jake ride by
i click-clack thats that i don't flash, i mash
i wave the uzi at 'em,
i make a movie out 'em.
nigga, my gun go off
you see the barrell turnin'
you feel the hollows burnin'
nigga now you learnin'
nigga, my gun go off
call it attempted murder
nigga i'm trying to merk you,
when i come back bustin'
nigga, my gun go off
don't try to say i'm trippin'
when i get to flippin'
then i smack the clip in,
nigga, my gun go off
we call it putting work in,
leaving niggas hurting,
homocide's learkin'
my gun go off
you better lose yourself in the moment
use it, f**k the music i'ma let it go
you only get one shot before i back out and fire back
at you hat, you back, you ass crack, you nut sack.
your cadillac if you make it to that,
i'm hitting that
the 70's was smack
the 80's crack.
the 90's was grimey
millennium mac man
clips on the whips i ride in 'em
bad bitches i ride inn 'em
don't worry i'll get 'em
gat jammed or un-jammed
god dam safest the safety don't work
squeeze the eagle, it chirp.
end up faced down in the dirt
more than hurt,
bring the beef where you hang out,
bang out,
shots ring out.
hit your shoulders trying to blow your brains out.
hit your homies in their legs,
bet they have their canes out tomorrow
you know tomorrow's just a day away,
if you can keep your heart beatin' then your ass awake.
nigga, my gun go off
you see the barrell turnin'
you feel the hollows burnin'
nigga now you learnin'
nigga, my gun go off
call it attempted murder
nigga i'm trying to merk you,
when i come back bustin'
nigga, my gun go off
don't try to say i'm tripping'
when i get to flippin'
then i smack the clip in,
nigga, my gun go off
we call it putting work in,
leaving niggas hurting,
homocide's learkin'
my gun go off
