"lay down (smoked)"
(feat. ned the wino)
move the fuck out the way,
this might get rain today
don’t wanna play now
i’m on a roll
that's where i plan to stay
forget the badge you made
and lay down
nigga better watch what the fuck you say to me
tricks are for kids don’t play with me
you’ll get smoked, i ain’t for the bullshit
got the chrome bulldog for that bullshit
problem nigga, it’s ok with me
the revolver always stay with me
you’ll get smoked, i ain’t for the bullshit
44 bulldog for that bullshit
nigga that was my mama crack spot
i got birth rights
i lay a nigga out on the turf nice
fuck a fist fight
shit shift all of sudden, you can box my box cutter as i can see it cutting
lord have mercy, jesus, lord have mercy
i bet this hurts you like it hurts me, it hurts
hot as hell when that gunpowder burning
what goes around don’t come around
when i’m putting work in
nigga swallow your pride and run you stick around your done
move the fuck out the way
this might get rain today
don’t wanna play now
i’m on a roll
that’s where i plan to stay
forget the badge you made
and lay down
i don’t know you what the fuck you wanna say to me
i’m telling you niggas don’t play with me
you’ll get smoked, i ain’t for the bullshit
got the chrome bulldog for that bullshit
body on the ground it’s ok with me
i make examples so niggas don’t play with me
you’ll get smoked, i ain’t for the bullshit
44 bulldog for that bullshit
i got a gun fetish, choppa in the trunk
i shoot a duck flying right out the sky with the punk
a nigga 8 out of 8 of moving targets
16 in the clip, i’ll dump them all in your whip
you think i’m joking, i’m not
you’ll find out when that glock get to dumping
and your back get hot
i got a temper, you don’t wanna test my patience
and end up doc’s new patient
stump your head on the pavement
you try and come at me on some brave shit
