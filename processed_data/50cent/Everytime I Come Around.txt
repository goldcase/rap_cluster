"everytime i come around"
(feat. kidd kidd)
n-y n-y
till i, d eye
n-y n-y
till i, d eye
i'm on its
everytime i come around, me i keep my gun around
its never on safety
i'm on it
niggas know when i'm around, fuck around its goin' down
no ifs or maybes
ring around the rosies, pockets full of oz's
niggas gettin' cake made
fuck with the homies while i got it on me
you'll get your big brick man
you niggas ain't seen shit yet, one false move and i click clack
that oo wop but y'all spit that, that hard white i flip that
that bad bitch get my dick wet, damn how hot can my shit get
boy get outta line get your ass checked, got 10 mil my last check
bitches stay where that cash at, diamonds on me i flash that
that rari' pedal i mash that, you pussy niggas i laugh at
that fuck shit that keep fuck niggas be doin' man i'm passed that
hood nigga down there on wall street, my stock run across nasdaq
girl face on my time piece, ridin' around my grammys
these broke niggas so grimy, i let em' hold the steel
i tell em' shoot to kill, i put south side on my back
i ain't talkin' bout' no tat'
when i'm outta town i hold it down i mean everywhere i'm at
all my niggas crazy stupid, koo koo got a loose screw
i might pew pew with that two two, then small bullets will mob through you
my bitch come from honolulu, with that dope ball in her doo doo
put it on a drain and shoot you, in the face, don't have a bluetooth on me
no but don't know voodoo, but i sure know how to shoot you
if i get caught i don't boo-hoo, i pick up the phone call booboo
he gonna bail me out in seconds, please don't let this rap shit fool you
i send shooters to your home, see i don't need know songs to move you
my gorilla goin' oo oo, boy your family could lose you
put you in a box like new shoes, you's a bitch pull down your tu-tu
when it come to gettin' money all i know is we need bookoo's
speakin' only in my rida' gang, know what we gonna do to you
