"you should be dead" lyrics
50 cent lyrics
"you should be dead"
i rock a nigga to sleep,
roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby
roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby
you should be dead by now
smile but wait until my shooters come round
with the talids and hollow tip rounds
in my hood they know how i be down (when i say dead, you dead)
nigga i show you my teeth all through the beef
paint the sidewalk red with the back of your head
shootouts in my hood like a daily routine
d's think im involved with a nigga hit hard
so when i empty the shell and the hollow tips fly
nigga you can cross your heart and hope not to die
come through squash the drama send niggas with llamas
they'll eat your ass up fuck being masked up
i was given the gift of life
first sabrinas since then ive been jammed up
and fucked with the nina
nana raised nine kids i turned out the meanest
i mean a menace
fuck with me and your finished
you should be dead by now
smile but wait until my shooters come round
with the talids and hollow tip rounds
in my hood they know how i be down (when i say dead, you dead)
homie i dont always pay my debts when i owe a nigga bullets
got an arsenal of infiltry and niggas to pull it
go head stay out on me, dump weight its nothing
i chase a nigga down, and touch him, catch him and buss him
bitch get out the way, baby while i spray it
i wet a nigga like a hydrant on a hot summer day
but you can catch me in may riding down with the k
better watch what you say, we get it popping today
yeah me i make it hot round here, i call the shots round here
i have a nigga tearing off your top round here
this is a land of broken hearts, where bullets shatter dreams
and everything a nigga want is only triple beams
southside
you should be dead by now
smile but wait until my shooters come round
with the talids and hollow tip rounds
in my hood they know how i be down (when i say dead, you dead)
roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby
roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby
