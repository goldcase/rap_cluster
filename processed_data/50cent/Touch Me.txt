"touch me"
yeah she so vicious, sweet kisses, taste delicous
maybe this is, who i should make the missus
let's conversate a little like a fiddle play with the middle
they way she shake when it wiggle i mean she hot like a kettle
well me i'm strapped with the metal when i go hard for the bread
so i line you up and i dent you, you run you're fucked when i catch you
you only eat cause i let you i hate the fact that i met you
when you could say that you know me and act like i'm your homie...
touch me, tease me, feel me and caress me (come on come on...)
hold on tight and don't let go, baby i'm about to explode (come on come on...)
cause all my love you can control... (yeah...)

i'm sittin' back while she suckin', she super freaky i love it
