"'till i collapse (freestyle)"
50 cent... shady records (shady records)
eminem (eminem)...dr. dre (dr. dre)
gggggggg g-unit
50 cent, shady, aftermath
the dreamteam
we got to get the get well cards
niggas is sick
feel this
motion picture shit
now don't think i won't hit you because i'm popular, i got p-90 ruger to pop at ya, catch you
slipping i'm give you what i got for ya, my clip loaded with 16 shots for ya, you never had a hot gun
on ya waste and blood on your shoe because a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you, homie
you ain't been threw what i been threw you not like me and i'm not like you.
i'm like an animal wit it when i spit it's crazy, got semi-autos to put holes and niggas try to play me,
one shot is not enough you need at least a uzi to move me, after four bottles of don
the kid start to feeling woozy, i write my life you write what you see in gangsta movies, i'm
gangsta to the core nigga you can't move me, i find my space at the top i got this rap shit
locked, i never heard of you you heard of me, i murder you, i spit shells to your convertible
lotis you notice richer or poor hollow steel go through your door this is war,
you scare of me you not prepared for me the kid is back
50 cents i know you like that i know you like that.
