50 cent lyrics
"surrounded by hoes"
everywhere i'm at everywhere i go, i stay surrounded by hoes
even when i'm tryin to be on the low, i'm recognized by hoes
man, its gotta be cause of the dough, its got to be cause of the dough
cause the game sure wasn't like this before, it wasn't like this before
50 cent i'm makin hits now
don't try an act like you ain't heard i'm the shit now
some bitches changed, cause they know i'm fittin to blow
you should see how they react when i come through the door
in the club my niggaz, we fittin to ball out
drink till we fall out
some shit jump off, nigga we goin all out
shots big enough to tear the fuckin wall out
i'll have your punk ass on the dance floor tryin to crawl out
i had bad luck, then my luck changed up
you see the range, you see the rims all blinged up
you ain't hear what i charge for 16, i'm makin a killin
these other rap niggaz just catching feelings
haha, yeah
yeah that's it nigga, what the fuck you thought
i ain't giving niggaz more than 16 for a motherfuckin freestyle
the fuck you want for free man
ya'll niggaz be wanting a lot for free man
fuck them other niggaz, other niggaz can't rap
that's why they give you 100 motherfuckin bars for nothing man
you know what i mean
fuck that shit man, i ain't gonna sit there rappin to you all night
haha, the fuck man
hey yo, sha money xl, nigga teamwork
we work hard nigga
