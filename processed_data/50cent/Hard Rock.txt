"hard rock"
(feat. ester dean)
here we go ready hard rock
here we go ready hard rock
what ya talkin bout
what ya talkin bout
what ya talkin bout
what ya talkin bout (my ass)
you can touch wherever you want
please don't touch my ass
i like the way that you pop it,
you know you turn me on,
i know the way that you move it you really got me going,
girl you ain't got to say nothing the way your body talk,
me i'm just patiently waiting to see you take it off,
shawty not complicated, i mean don't complicate it,
i wanna get you off the floor, you and i be fornicating,
that's how it's supposed to go,
i know you know just how to drop it low,
drop drop it low, drop it low,
dr dr drop it low,
all my ladies let me see you throw your legs up,
put your hands up ladies put your hands up,
and all the fellas grab my ta ta's,
fellas grab your mama,
you can touch wherever you want
please don't touch my ass,
only a hood girl no good girl,
maybe a superfreak,
i don't wanna talk girl, i wanna fuck girl,
then maybe we can grab a bite to eat,
if you wanna play games we can play games,
for you can play with me all day,
we don't have to wait girl we can mate girl,
we can get it in right away,
funny how you like it,
i'll give it to you every way you want,
not like a cow girl, you hesitating baby get up on it,
off that shy shit,
off them good girl games,
off now all clothes,
off when you walk with me,
all my ladies let me see you throw your legs up,
put your hands up ladies put your hands up,
and all the fellas grab my ta ta's,
fellas grab your mama,
you can touch wherever you want
please don't touch my ass,
i'll scream make a scene if you touch that,
that's right i'll fight if you rub that,
i know it's all about it,
...
girls stop playing with me,
