"i gotta win" lyrics
50 cent lyrics
"i gotta win"
yeah this is what you call inner city blues
now that i got you here i got your attention (i'm a winner winner)
i wanna welcome you all to the winner's circle
i'm a winner winner, look i gotta win
after i win i got to win over again
please don't confuse a, nigga for a loser
watch me maneuver, with the ruger
look i gotta win
by any means, i'm a 7 or 11
trip'-6 or a cee-lo, you ain't hear that from me though
my occupation's operation get money
got that beam on that 9; got that money on my mind
got no patience, man i grind like i'm runnin out of time
see the sun shine reflect off my shine, you're blind
you write hot lines like mine lines, you're signed
that bitch bad, her ass so fat class she mine
i'm addicted to it, me i got to win
over and over and over again
this quest for the paper is never gon' end
so to my competition here's the message i send
man you ain't a shooter, you ain't a robber
you talk like a mobster, you fuckin blogger
i say some hard shit you wan' say somethin harder
smack the shit out you, you wan' run to the law huh?
this movie's a rerun, you seen this before
she used a vibrator and she suck on your boy
i stand out like a sore thumb, i'm hard to ignore
you get addicted to the dick then have to go through withdrawals
after i go through the drawers, i'm back on my grizzly
back gettin busy, causin a frenzy
it's nuttin new to me, there's nuttin they could do to me
that ain't been done to me - this is fun for me
