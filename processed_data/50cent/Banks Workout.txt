"banks workout"
i hear a lotta talkin niggaz must be mad at banks
but there only one problem niggaz ain't as bad as banks
nigga yous front you gon get shot down
we fend to pump crack at cho spot now, g-unit
nigga ain't nuttin change
you move i'll blow your brains
these niggaz don't really want war (nah)
they just walk around frontin
cause i walk around stuntin
why you think the long pump is in the trunk for (yea)
if you really want somethin we can show up at your front door
i know my history, my family tree done said "master" (uh-huh)
fuck livin positive, cause negativity spreads faster
a celebrity has ta, bulletproof his car
cause big hits come flyin through ya door like casper (woo)
i'm smokin out the jar (jar) scopin out the bar
distracted see shorty breast pokin out the bra (uh-huh)
not the type to go spark metal in
start thinkin you gangsta cause you hit a park yellow van (yea)
act hard but ya heart made a marshmellows man
talk tough, til you get cuffed and start tellin damn
everyday i got a new bitch and when i'm done wit her
it'll look like she dived head first in the pool wit it (god damn)
you only gon wind up dead tryin to prove shit
i put chalk around ya head like a pool stick (yea)
i gotta have bucks on the waist
i'm hungry like a south african with fly stuck to his face( waa)
catch banks in a truck full of bass (uh-huh)
remember i'm a batchelor, the 4 or 5 ducks outta space
you could either get bucked or get ya ass jumped
the only tigger you touch is on a gas pump
i got my own personal slave she really got a curfew
cook and clean for the kid like silly in color purple (uh-huh uh-huh)
i know you wanna pop me but (but)
if i hit you first, the exit wound gon be the size of a hockey puck (ahh)
fuck, i really hold the rubber
i send +sparks+ at you and i don't mean emilio or bubba
i'm aimin for a video cover, huge tall bustas
a pound and a philly hold the smuggler
g=unit's whats up right now
the gucci cloth is on a newport sign upsidedown
you gotta come a little harder, nigga
you wear jerseys while mine a throwback and yours is a starter(ha ha ha)
you still gotta beg a hoe (hoe)
and you mad cause you blowin on oregano
you niggaz'll never blow
anyone to step in my ring is brave
i don't know a thing about hair stylin but i can make a finger weave (err)
short stay leave her butt in the telly
lace up the beef and brocclis peanut butter and jelly
i'm about to get this deal (uh-huh) shorty know
thats why she foamin out the grill like a alka-seltzer pill
i ain't loud around a snitch (nah)
i don't crowd around a btich (nah)
the jumpsuit match wit the carolina kicks
i been sick since niggaz was on harlod miner dick
i could call up a chick and put a child around her lips (woo)
niggaz can't stand the fact that i'm real
i kidnap the queen from the castle and put her back on the pill
gimme barbie at her best (uh-huh)
bacardi at the chest (uh-huh)
i'm similar to the young marcus darvy at the desk
useta have ta push up, now i hardly got ta press
got two guns, and both lead to cardiac arrest
my success got suckers salty (salty)
blowin steam like a cup of coffee
click pow get these fuckas off me
i hear a lotta talkin niggaz must be mad at banks
but there only one problem niggaz ain't as bad as banks
nigga yous front you gon get shot down
we fend to pump crack at cho spot now, g-unit
nigga ain't nuttin change
you move i'll blow your brains
