"ski mask way"

nigga that watch is nice
that's what you bought from me
that chain is nice
that's what you bought from me

that's what you bought from me?
take that shit off, move i'll break you off properly
i get mine the fast way, ski mask way
make money
make money, money, money
nigga if you ask me
it's the only way
take money
take money, money, money
you wanna spray at me? go head
the last nigga that tried
got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
ya little sister callin you stupid
reason why?
her and ya momma in the livin room now hog-tied
i came up wit two new ways to get rich i cant wait
got a brand new cig and that old thirty eight
i be scheming to put a lil' bread on my plate
watchin dre serve skunk through the hole in the gate
i stick a nigga for his shine sell em' back the next day
you thought i really wanted ya pussy bitch please
this is stash house, jack pot, leave her them keys
my black g-unit hoody just reak of marijuana
cocaine comin out my pores in the sauna
im serious man i'm so sincere
this the flow right here that fucked up jeffery's career
make money, take money
yeah nigga yeah
nigga that watch is nice
that's what you bought from me
that chain is nice
that's what you bought from me
them earrings is nice
that's what you bought from me?
take that shit off, move i'll break you off properly
i get mine the fast way, ski mask way
make money
make money, money, money
nigga if you ask me
it's the only way
take money
take money, money, money
whos dat peepin in my window

catch me n' niggas slippin out pumpin dat d
give me a lil' crew i'll have em' pumpin for me
the more product i take the more paper we see
change my name in n-y they don't know where i be
yeah a nigga doin dirt but a nigga low key
nigga that watch is nice
that's what you bought from me
that chain is nice
that's what you bought from me
them earrings is nice

take that shit off, move i'll break you off properly
i get mine the fast way, ski mask way
make money

nigga if you ask me
it's the only way
take money
