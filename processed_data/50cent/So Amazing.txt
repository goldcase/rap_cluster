"so amazing"
summer, winter, spring, and fall
i'll be around to catch ya calls
cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
and i adore you
you always brighten up my day
i never ever let you wait
cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
and you're amazing (so amazing)
i'm from city to city to shop the show
see me i been gridin' across the globe
i hustle hard to get the grib fa sho'
so when i make time to call you, you should pick up the phone
tell me, whats on your mind when you're alone
have ya touchin' on yourself, girl all in the zone
now if i turned you on
what things i say would i be wrong
then i wouldn't wanna be right
matter fact i'd be on the next flight
tryna get it on with you tonight
do the things you like
touch the right spot, have ya piped and hot
while the wind blow through your hair in the drop
just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sex
and let me to what i do until you climax
you can go straight to sleep after its all over
in the mornin' roll over and we can start over
summer, winter, spring, and fall
i'll be around to catch ya calls
cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
and i adore you
you always brighten up my day
i never ever let you wait
cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
and you're amazing (so amazing)
yeah i called just to say hope you havin' a nice day
you're special, i get into you, oops i mean i'm into you
every chance i get, i find time to spend with you
jet to bring you to me, just to watch a movie
better yet to watch you climb into the jacuzzi
bubbles in the bath, don in the glass
funny how time flies when you full of laughs
its fun but before long, a nigga gotta dash
for the lifestyle i live, a nigga need cash
to come quick, so i don't fuck with the stash
i know you like pumps and boots
i like jeeps and coupes, so i grind all the time, just gimme some loot
i put a spell on you, i like to call it a spell
in the bedroom, workin' it well, i don't kiss and tell
but i don't care if you kiss and tell
you can tell your girlfriend the details
summer, winter, spring, and fall
i'll be around to catch ya calls
cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
and i adore you
you always brighten up my day
i never ever let you wait
cause you're my baby (you're my baby)
and you're amazing (so amazing)
