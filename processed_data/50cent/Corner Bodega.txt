"corner bodega"
aight, check this shit out
y'all niggaz gon' stay in the car
i'm'a go right over here and see somethin
gimme ten minutes, if i don't come out, y'all come in
the money stays in the car 'til i say so...
aiyyo, whattup whattup, man
this is what y'all niggaz is workin' wit' for 22 cents a gram?
man, when i come up in here treat me like i'm fam
i could go uptown and get this shit for 16 cents a gram
bottom line is, man, i gotta cop and go
i got a spot and i can't afford to stop the flow
poppi, what the fuck is the matter wit' ya man?
standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
i ain't on no funny shit i'm on some get this money shit
every four days in pa i move another brick
according to the da i sold dope in va
my crew stay in queens but my plates say va
i'll show you where i rest at, it aint hard to find me
let me buy a brick and get the other on cossimy
(hey, the ice is hot man) i know, don't remind me
if i catch another case i'ma kill guiliani
it ain't even safe to sell a pack at night
got task ridin 'round the projects on mountain bikes
ny ain't the same, it's ot playa
you can go and cop coke from the corner bodega
hit the highway and take it to a town near you
and get that money man, get that money man
now, if you come to 1-3-4 and i'm not around
that means i copped and i went outta town
you motherfuckers know how i get down
about my money man, about my money man
