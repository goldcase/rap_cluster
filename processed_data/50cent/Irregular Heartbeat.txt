"irregular heartbeat"
(feat. jadakiss & kidd kidd)
nigga, you pussy, you scared
i can hear your heartbeat
why the fuck would you come around here?
i can hear your heartbeat
yeah, you know a dog sense fear
i can hear your heartbeat
you bark while we bite around here
i can hear your heartbeat
we ain't cut from the same cloth, we into different shit
i want the bread, you want the bitch
come out your mouth slick i'll get you hit
my niggas hungry, they hit a lick
fuck who you're with, niggas'll dump a clip
we by the school yard waiting for you to get your kid
i caught a 81 felony on my last bid
kept calm, made bond, i'm on that shit
you think my rap shit a gimmick, i ain't seen parole in a minute
truth be told these niggas is hoes
once the shit set off, man, anything goes
through the windows of your soul, the eyes never lie
if you ain't scared to die, nigga, why would you cry?
30 something and you ain't even open your mouth yet
social media is giving cowards an outlet
see him in person, say something, i doubt that
rather get caught with it than get caught without that
trying to back peddle and stumble on the curve
you stayin' at the ground, you mumblin' your words
literally i can see your heart pumpin' through your shirt
pussy your whole life, you always been a bird
scared for so long it's all up in your nerves
screw 9-1-1, you probably call up the reserves
and i'm killin' you first, if we ever do a purge
and you know what it is, kid, whenever we emerge
and i'm tragical, traumatical, no match, incompatible
nigga, you vaginal
money for bail, money to bail
dead or in jail, heaven or hell
feds on my coat tail, snitches given court tells
kept fate when all hope fail
niggas rattin', all they missin' is the tail like mickey mouse
call me mickey mantle when i bat you in the mouth
i bring them hammers out, we ain't trying to build a house
niggas on them songs rappin' shit they ain't about
i'm from the n-o, we don't scrap, we bang it out
bang, i'm the one that came in your house for the chickens
left a nigga brains hangin' out like we chillin'
stankin' like shipments, over my shillings
hump your security, rida gang in the building
