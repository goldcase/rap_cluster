"animal ambition"
i got that animal (animal) ambition
i got that animal (animal) ambition
i got that animal (animal) ambition
i got that animal (animal) ambition
why give her love and affection
she just want some bread
i ain't talking of texting
i just want some head
she from a pirus sip
where all them niggas wear red
i ain't flying no flags but i'm a gangster bitch
i say say no to drugs then i do that shit
got a blue fleet of whips
i'm so hood nigga rich
you don't like the way i do it nigga eat your dick
i just call em when i want em don't need your bitch
see my blood on these diamonds everything proper
your shit look grown and your shit look copper
it's turning homie that's why your turning on me
admit it i made it, i can't be faded
i roll it up in public i'm a cancer man
smoke it out in the open like i'm in amsterdam
i do a hundred miles an hour switching lens in my lane
see my name around the globe niggas know who i am
i got that animal (animal) ambition
you say you hustle like a hustle i be moving shit
had a couch and a u-haul filled up with bricks
got them straps and long clips filled up with led
so when we count on the paper it better come back correct
we out in new orleans baby niggas hungry for brick
i do that knife for stuntin get shot in the head
every hood i go through they fuck with me you dig?
got the eye of the tiger i'm on that animal shit
i got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant
damn scared of rats, but i'm ready for anything
it's the unit my nigga, take a look at my face
see if you test me they'll arrest me i'll be catching a case
new york is a concrete jungle, where niggas got to get paid
get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed
look at me wrong and your dead
you should be very afraid
i don't know how to behave
i'm tamed fresh out the cage
urrrrrrrrrrhhhh
