"warning you"
(feat. skylar grey)
when they say my time is up
and i am just collecting dust
don't turn on me
don't turn on me
and when they claim that i'm washed up
or when my guns begin to rust
i'm warning you
don't turn on me
december 9, '97 i told jay i'm gonna' blow
failing's not an option, my son's turning one years old
i wrote a verse about the night i just spent in central bookings
cause my grandpa coffee pot had cocaine cookin'
fast forward my grind, 9-8-'99 more eigths more o's
broken in nickels and dimes
i told niggas i'd make it, they was doubting me then
picture me zonin' on the park bench pushin' my pit
who needs enemies my friend keep shootin' my friends
they takin' hits now, they'll blow your brains out for a biz
call me a dreamer, cause i could see myself on top
word to sabrina, i'm gettin' my ass off this block
when they say my time is up
and i am just collecting dust
don't turn on me
don't turn on me
and when they claim that i'm washed up
or when my guns begin to rust
i'm warning you
don't turn on me
no no no no no, don't don't don't don't don't
no no no no no, don't don't don't don't don't
no no no no no, don't don't don't don't don't
ain't it funny how the niggas i came up with wasn't bumpin' me
product of the slum, i guess it's misery loves company
told 'em i'm a winner i be something to believe in
they was more concerned who was rollin' up the weed then
jmj didn't work, neither did columbia
got shot, got dropped, one hell of a summer huh?
one year recovery feel like a bag of broken bones
bill collectors come around that's when you know you're on your own
strap the vest, cock the chrome, they countin' me out, i'm a show em
i fought my way out of mother fuckin' corners before 'em
i'm better under pressure i'm built for it
i been the under dog all my life, i'm still here boy
when they say my time is up
and i am just collecting dust
don't turn on me
don't turn on me
and when they claim that i'm washed up
or when my guns begin to rust
i'm warning you
don't turn on me
no no no no no, don't don't don't don't don't
no no no no no, don't don't don't don't don't
no no no no no, don't don't don't don't don't
em and dre gave me a shot and i ran with it
homie in the cell saying "damn, my man did it"
get rich or die trying made it to the top
i'm fightin' off my competition trying not to drop
it seems like no one seen him fuckin' with the key
all they see was me tryna take off their fuckin' head
they don't see the slap, all they hear is the shot
as soon as somebody hit, i'm sure they'll run to the cops
i'm not a bully of the east, if i don't start no beef
i meet aggression with aggression, i learned that on the streets
i see em frontin' on they blogs, sayin' i'm done
like i ain't got that flow they know be number one
when they say my time is up
and i am just collecting dust
don't turn on me
don't turn on me
and when they claim that i'm washed up
or when my guns begin to rust
i'm warning you
don't turn on me
