"money"
i'm on that bullshit
i'm, i'm, back on that bullshit
i'm on that bullshit
i'm, i'm, back on that bullshit
startin to feel like there's nothin left to talk about but the, money, money
bill collectors keep comin when a nigga fucked up, to get money, money
nigga i don't give a fuck 'bout these hoes
i'm focused on the money, money (money) money!
look, i don't wan' talk 'bout these hoes
let's talk about money, money (money) money!
in high school i had coke and dope money
i blew, now i'm sittin on bugatti boat money
i'm eatin, i get money, nigga i shit money
it smell like benjamins, it boosts my adrenaline
go 'head fuck around, i got marksmen hit money
you fuckin with that ebt welfare wic money
who wan' catch a fade? fuck that! catch a blade
catch a case, bail bond, i'm out the next day
got that gold (hammer), gold (2 legit) proper money
talkin 'bout private jet, heliport chopper money
and a nigga still ridin with the chopper on me
i don't trick, e'ry now and then i toss her money
fuck, nut, get up, that's abortion money
i'll kill if i have to, don't force me homie
i get that schoolyard duct tape extortion money
i hate when niggaz act like bitches cause it costs me money
what the fuck!
i'm in london blowin pounds, japan blowin yen
it's the methodical diabolical nigga with a grin
my stash look like a rainbow, my money is gay
nowadays i'm just happy things are goin my way
i'm straight, some say i got more than i need
mucho dinero out in m√©xico, they growin my weed
it's amazing, i made it here on my own
i got a frog, a dog with a solid gold bone
an accountant to count, the amount i spent
wine cellar full of shit, we could all get bent
i got it made, i got brinks truck money
euros, francs, you wan' borrow some from me?
my bank statements have you niggaz like "damn! "
bitch i got more (francs) than a hot dog man
get married, pay for one bitch, i'll buy her bar food
kids don't try this shit at home, you can't do the shit i do
whassup?
