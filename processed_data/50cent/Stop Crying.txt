"stop crying"
they say they do it, like i do it with no mask on
nigga, get the fuck outta line, you getting blast on
jesus let the weak roam the earth without a purpose.
i’ll stomp ya fucking head til it’s under the surface
now i need you to get it through ya bloodclot head
‘fore i put a bullet through ya bloodclot dreads
these niggas ain't made of the same shit i’m made of
i double click for my man if he needs a favour
i let a nigga slide he came back and almost shot me
and he was thinking i was scared, nah nigga not me
you don’t understand i was raised by the vultures
still laughing like hyenas in the crib full of roaches
call grandmami mommy cause mommy already dead
daddy been missin’ since i was a little kid
now who dared go there playin’ games with the orphan
they know my pedigree test me i’mma off ‘em
stop the bloodclot crying
the kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
don’t cry, dry ya eyes
don’t cry, dry ya eyes
that first body drop, we just getting started, death come in three’s
ar15, m16, semi-automatic, murder machine
wave that, blaze that, give a nigga wings
when that blade enter flesh it’s an emergency
ya love leak, heart open call the surgery
feels like my last girlfriend i lost her
on second thought i know just where i left her, the alter
see, i’m at an advantage i don’t care about tomorrow
find out that i ain't frontin’ when then patience start to fall
you know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
9 bullet wounds know, now i’m half crazy
what is that a tear i see forming in ya eye
why are you so frightened we’re all gonna die
you can say a prayer when i’m coming like the reaper
staring through that sight on the top of my heater
