you didn't like the way i wore my hair (what up)
you didn't like the style a clothes i wear (uh huh)
you didn't like the little things i do
just tryin to be close to you (c'mon, c'mon)
look i done changed up bitch, i done came up
my neck, my wrist, my ears, my fists are all blinged up
in the hood they say 50 "you a grimy nigga"
with the rims in that coupe stay shiny nigga (stay shiny nigga)
when you disrespect me is where i draw the line
you seen my artwork but you ain't seen me draw the nine
come through the hood, you'll get shot homey just cause i say so
i'm the hottest shit on this street, i don't do j lo (here we go)
(call me) why you naggin me? {naggin you?}
