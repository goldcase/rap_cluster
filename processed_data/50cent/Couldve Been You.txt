"could've been you"
(feat. r. kelly)
yeah 50,
i gave her books to read,
feed her mind with knowledge,
gave her street smarts,
sh-t you can't get in college,
she's a reflection of me,
so you know she the sh-t,
if i'm a star she a star, if i'm rich she rich,
that's my dog,
i tell her stay she wanna go,
i tell her go she wanna stay,
that's my dog,
you know a b-tch usually don't mean nothing to me,
that's right but that's my dog,
i go left she go right, i go up she go down,
she couldn't listen now she ain't around,
so ungrateful screaming i hate you,
she must got amnesia,
b-tch i made you now,
just think just think, that coulda been you,
just think, that shoulda been you,
yeah, with me i share the world with you,
but you ain't ride with a rider so i ain't f-cking with you,
say say say girl,
come here,
no, you no, you, her yeah,
you go,
the reason you didn't get picked
because you got your nose up your ass,
you smelling your sh-t, but tonight you met your match,
i'm smelling my sh-t too now how you like that,
you coulda had this dude and anything you choose,
and that girl you lose cause i ain't f-cking with ya,
shopping sprees drop top hat blowing in the wind,
coulda been you, living lavish,
instead it's your girlfriend,
but you tripping while we sipping,
in the back of a big...
some say it hurts when you supposed to win and you lose,
you were supposed to be sure baby, you was confused,
i had a thang for ya, i had a ride for ya,
house, cars, kids and a pet name for ya,
p-ssy cat, i told you i'll make it you ain't believe,
i guess coming up it was hard, it was easy to leave,
i think about it maybe i'm right, maybe i'm wrong,
either way shorty life goes on,
when your around my smiles a grin,
my thoughts are a sin,
you asked can we try again,
i ain't f-cking with you,
it's on the club jumpin,
i'm tryna to get my liquor in
you want sometin ? again
i'm staring at your thicker friend,
i guess i'm like will smith in the pursuit of happyness,
in my hood we all hustle in pursuit of the same sh-t,
just think just think, that coulda been you,
just think, that shoulda been you,
yeah, with me i share the world with you,
but you ain't ride with a rider so i ain't f-cking with you,
there ain't no other way to put it except,
i know you'll understand girl it's...
... see us in the back of the club popping bottles
and it coulda been you but no
said it coulda been
coulda been you yeaah,
said it coulda been
coulda been you.
