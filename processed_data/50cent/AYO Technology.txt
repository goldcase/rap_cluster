"ayo technology"
(feat. justin timberlake, timbaland)
something special,
unforgettable,
50 cent (cent),
justin (tin),
timbaland (land), god damn (damn)
she she, she want it, i want to give it to her
she know that, it's right here for her
i want to, see you break it down
i'm ballin', throwing money around
she work it girl, she work the pole
she break it down, she take it low
she fine as hell, she about the dough
she doing her thing out on the floor
her money money, she makin' makin'
look at the way she shakin' shakin'
make you want to touch it, make you want to taste it
have you lustin' for her, go crazy face it
now don't stop, get it, get it
the way she shakin' make you want to hit it
think she double jointed from the way she split
got you're head f**ked up from the way she did it
she's so much more than you're used to
she know's just how to move to seduce you
she gone do the right thing and touch the right spot
dance in you're lap till you're ready to pop
she always ready, when you want it she want it
like a nympho, the info, i show you where to meet her
on the late night, till daylight the club jumpin'
if you want a good time, she gone give you what you want
baby this a new age, you like my new craze
let's get together maybe we can start a new phase
the smokes got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice baby
why don't you come over here, you got me saying
aayooh
i'm tired of using technology, why don't you sit down on top of me
aayooh
i'm tired of using technology, i need you right in front of me
ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
ooh, she wants it, (so), i gotta give it to her,
ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
ooh, she wants it, (so), i gotta give it to her,
your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
got a thing for that thing she got
the way she make it shake, the way she make it pop
make it rain for us so she don't stop
i ain't got to move, i can sit and watch
in her fantasy, there's plain to see
just how it be, on me, backstrokin', sweat soaking
all into my set sheets
when she ready to ride, i'm ready to roll
i'll be in this bitch till the club close
what should i do, one thing on all fours
now that that shit should be against the law
from side to side, let the ride, break it down (down down)
you know i like, when you hike and you throw it all around
different style, different move, damn i like the way you move
girl you got me thinking about, all the things i do to you
let's get it poppin' shorty we can switch positions
from the couch to the counters in my kitchen
baby this a new age, you like my new craze
let's get together maybe we can start a new phase
the smokes got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice baby
why don't you come over here, you got me saying
aayooh
i'm tired of using technology, why don't you sit down on top of me
aayooh
i'm tired of using technology, i need you right in front of me
ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
ooh, she wants it, (so), i gotta give it to her,
ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
ooh, she wants it, (so), i gotta give it to her,
your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you
