"i'm supposed to die tonight" lyrics
50 cent lyrics
"i'm supposed to die tonight"
ah man
you know where the niggas be at right?
take me to 'em
all through the hood, i keep hearin' niggas sayin'
i'm supposed to die tonight
niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay
i'm down to ride tonight
we rolling, whip stolen, ak loaded
i'm down to ride tonight
we smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded
somebody gon' die tonight
this is nothin' new, i been in the position before
grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
different day, same shit, old mac, new clip
thirty two hollow tips, gloves, no rubber grip
i'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
i catch 'em slippin', i have 'em tongue kissin' my tec
wanna come test me, pussy boy don't try
police responds, never fast enough, the shots fired
don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' wit son
'fore we find out where ya bitch gets her hair and nails done
its elementary, life is but a dream
you know row, row ya boat, your blood forms a stream
after you get hit, you should've thought about the shit
you took that paper, you take a life or ya life get took bitch
sometimes, i sit and look at life from a different angle
don't know if i'm god's child or i'm satan's angel
in 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
i simply would've wished that my music would be a hit
big said damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
and pray for my downfall, i understand it all
but me, i'm a little more flashy a nigga
so chances are, i'ma have to blast me a nigga
i'm on that keflon vest shit, that wild wild west shit
and eighty one 1 carrot stones in my necklace
i shine so hard, i make motherfuckers wanna kill me
every projects and every hood i go, they feel me
know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real b
i don't talk that rich shit, but nigga i'm filthy
when i come out to play, had my mom been with me
you could bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
homeboy, frontin' on me will shorten your life span
hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
