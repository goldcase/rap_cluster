"wait until tonight"
if you think you're lonely now
wait until tonight, girl
ah man
if you think you're lonely now
wait until tonight, girl
i'm waitin' on you to come, baby i'm that man
bedroom superhero, naked i'm batman
i kill it then i give ya mouth-to-mouth, cpr
bring ya back to life, climax, start your after life
bounce up and down on my love, this is chronic
have it how you want it, my back shot's bionic
she givin' me something i can feel like en vogue
unload then reload, recharge, i'm back on
back at it, fuckin' up the sprigs in her craftmatic
jack rabbit, addiction, i don't wanna break that habit
your boy toy man, child it's cool, you can play with me
city life, bright lights, tonight you can stay with me
i wanna share thoughts, let's talk, go for a walk
fantasies, we can get loose right in the park
bullseye right through her head, to her heart
it's mental and physical, when you're gone, i'll be missin' you
you gon' get it, you gon' get it
i got a plan for you (got it all planned girl)
girl it's on 'til the 'mon when you come through (haha)
i can't think of a thing that i won't do (what you wan' do?)
when you come and i get my hands on you (wait 'til i get you girl)
i'm curtis mayfield, marvin, the new bobby womack
2012 freak shit, baby i'm all that
the touchin' and the teasin', the pleasure's the reason
i'm sure she'll be open from the lickin' and strokin'
or how i say a line and it stimulates her mind
my sense of humor, i make her smile while passin' time
it's sexual, it's not perverted or obscene
the foreplay we play, until i touch her 'til she cream
cash rules the shortie, she's something out a dream
half j-lo half jessica biel, she in between
got that island girl swag, she dutty wine
when we get back to the spot, that ass is mine
see how i switch gears, her bra gone it's on
it's showtime, it's my turn to perform
leave the lights on, while i get it, i got it good
she sayin' she love my show, i'm sayin' i knew she would
you gon' get it, you gon' get it
i got a plan for you (got it all planned girl)
girl it's on 'til the 'mon when you come through (haha)
i can't think of a thing that i won't do (what you wan' do?)
when you come and i get my hands on you (wait 'til i get you girl)
