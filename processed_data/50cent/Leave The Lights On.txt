"leave the lights on"
say man we don't need much to come to the freak show

fuck that, leave the lights on
girl, 68-69 leave the lights on
can't see shit leave the lights on
girl, i can't see shit leave the lights on
girl, leave the lights on
68-69 leave the lights on
damn, leave the lights on
zip down my zipper and play with the python
girl i make the bed rock like i'm on a yacht
shit citation tink prick lick my cock baby
time's money check my turbion movement
i'm rich bitch, i say move, you get to moving
and now my bentley moves on, tight nigga i'm crusing
it ain't hard to tell who's running, who's loosing
got a pent house around my wrist, i'm flashing out
condo around my neck, i'm cashing out
i'm nigga rich, got everything a rich nigga get
i got whip for days, i got kick for days

ferogamo, dolce gabana, red bottom blues
plus i got the prada collection
i might leave my socks on sex on old habbits

hope the head games good you be looking exotic
seven hour flight she already 'rotic

talk to me girl while we fuck, i can't understand
let's get to stroking, boning, moaning, groaning
start in the afternoon, end up the next morning
started the next round, lick from my neck down
so she did do felatio correct. wow!

so everything you do to me i do to you

what the fuck she tryna say with her tongue stuck in my ear
68-69 all the time, shorty
you can be a freak for me
come and be a freak for me
baby i can lick yours and you can lick mine shorty
you can be a freak for me
come and be a freak tonight
this kid right, leave the lights on

zip down my zipper and play with the python
