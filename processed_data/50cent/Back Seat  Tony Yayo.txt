50 cent lyrics
"back seat / tony yayo"
(feat. tony yayo (g-unit))
now play my tony yayo shit
yeah, 50 cent
g-unit
remix
tony yayo
we gonna do it again
back seat of the caddy truck or tahoe
back seat of the benz truck or expo
back seat of x5 or range rov'
so when i pick you up, you know how this shit go - hoe
hey yo, my truck talk for me
if i was bummy and ugly
your bitch'll still have love for me
as long as i push a truck, rims chunky
never open my lips, your bitch wanna fuck me
beep the air horn, hop in turn the heat on
pick you up off the streets get your feet warm
she giving sex cause the lex truck takes unleaded
big thick thighs, eyes browner than sahara deserts
deuce-deuce, bitches, yeah they caught your eye
and them loud system full of bass and highs
you see that x5 bm
packed with puerto ricans
bad mommies on the low, just creepin
niggas be frontin like they bubbling coke
but they really struggling with a high car note, ha ... (yeah)
might see me in the jeep
rollin' 'round 4 deep
and you know we on the creep
nigga, i'm holdin' it
back seat of my truck lets swing an episode
fuck a hotel we have sex on the road
i pull the seats back
put the sheets in the luggage rack
pull out my balls
and play an aaron hall track
i tell a chick "bend over, mami"
hit 'em with the henny dick
now my windows foggy
its time to party, i got tv's, cd's and dvd's
now bitch, get on your knees
you could be a model chick or a silly hood rat
don't cum on my leather, don't stain my floor mats
where's your baby mama?
she in the truck and i'm blessin her
undressing her
make hop out for air re-freshener
i ain't stressing her
'cause my rims keep checkin her
she's 21, my rim size older than her
twenty two's
niggas say they want beef
but when they see me in the street
they don't slow down to speak
'cause they know i'm holdin ..
