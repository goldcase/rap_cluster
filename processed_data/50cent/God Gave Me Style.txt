"god gave me style"
god gave me style
god gave me grace
god gave me style
god gave me grace
god put a smile on my face
haha, god put this smile on my face
god made me shine like the sun
god make me shine like the sun
sometimes i feel like i'm the one
sometimes i feel like i'm the one
it ain't my fault
i just reach for style, i'm hot i breaks it down
it ain't my fault, you can't break it down the way i break it down
listen you can call me what you want, black and ugly
but you can't convince me the lord don't love me
when my cds drop, they sell the best
you call it luck, why can't it just be i'm blessed
i'm a trackstar, runnin' through life, chasin' my dream
best deal i made was tradin' the mic for that triple beam.
i zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell
so what happens to a changed man who dies in a cell
i need no answers to these questions, cuz time will tell
got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
don't much good come from me, but my music
is a gift given from god so i'ma use it (yeaaah!)
god gave me style
god gave me grace
god gave me style
god gave me grace
god put a smile on my face
haha, god put this smile on my face
god made me shine like the sun
god make me shine like the sun
sometimes i feel like i'm the one
sometimes i feel like i'm the one
it ain't my fault
i just reach for style, i'm hot i breaks it down
it ain't my fault, you can't break it down the way i break it down
some days, i'm in the crowd all by myself
bunch of niggas around i'm still by myself
i drift off on a cloud by myself
thinkin' bout nothin' more than life, what else
these days its hard to tell who really cares for me
so you when hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
i put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
if times are hard, when you hear it, know you'll be okay
a old g told me god's favorites have a hard time
you out the hood, that's good now stay on the grind
i'm a sponge, knowledge and wisdom, i absorb fast
i'm in a class by myself, you do the math
god gave me style
god gave me grace
god gave me style
god gave me grace
god put a smile on my face
haha, god put this smile on my face
god made me shine like the sun
god make me shine like the sun
sometimes i feel like i'm the one
sometimes i feel like i'm the one
