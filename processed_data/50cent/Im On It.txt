50 cent lyrics
"i'm on it"
i’m on it, i-i i’m on it
i blow a hundred million, make another hundred mill bitch
i’m on it, i-i i’m on it
i hustle hard, oh my god
look at me i’m so rich
i’m on it, i-i i’m on it
my swag on a hundred, yeah that fly shit i want it quick
i’m on it, i-i i’m on it
i’m always on point man i make niggas so sick
i’m chin chillin, crystal spillin’
hip hop’s villain cause i’m makin’ a killin’
niggas wan’ try me, i’m strapped with the lammy
if jay’s illuminati, what am i? am i bugatti?
ladi dodi, we like to party
big 4 in the morning, go outside and catch a body
i ball full time nigga this is not a hobby
if you don’t know about me, better ask somebody
yeah, i’m grimey, my wrist so shiny
my audemar i blew a mill, i’m back to making money
my swag make her want me
why else would she be on me
i bet she hardly want me? i think she want to blow
lick me like a lolly, li-lick me like a lolly
her ass ain't all that but her tits like dolly’s
give me that punani, g-g-give me that punani
now this is motivation make me want more money
i got it, black card in my wallet
find me on locations with model bitches?
fly shit i rock it, tom ford, exotic
bitches on my dick now that i moved up out the projects
one for the money, two for the show
i’m ghetto like a muthafucker, what you didn’t know?
took threes for my niggas gettin’ 8 hundred an o
kush burn slow, i b-burn dough and sip merlot like i’m on furlow
fr-fresh up out the pen, i’m back at it again
thumpin’ like the system in my new big body benz
look i’m a fat joe, my neck glow
the lights hit the ice, its a special effects show
tinkle twinkle little star
no-one here knows who you are
me i’m so big, notorious you dig
the paper’s no problem when ya fucking with tha kid
