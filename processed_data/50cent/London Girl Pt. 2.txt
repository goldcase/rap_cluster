she-she's suck me 'til i came, then she suck me more
she sucked me with a condome, then she suck me raw!
she a freak, my-my gun thing girl
it's not another bitch like her in the whole wide world!
hey tony! (what, bruh?) i think i'm in love!
this bitch licked all over my ass-crack, huh?
from the window she went to the waaall
from the tip of the dick - to the baaaall
i mean freaky shit, she do it aaall
went from red two, to pay to upon!
i told her lil' kim said it: "take it in the pot!"

my-my-my london giiirl!  {whoooooooooooooooooooo kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid!}
i left her on my bed, she was masterbatin'
she told me, give it to her quit procrastinatin'.
she's just like me, this is fascinatin'
she's a freak, i'm a freak, isn't this quite unique?
we'll be fuckin' for an hour, cuff her to the bed
i'm not a cop! - i'm an outlaw, billy the kid!
role-play all day! - staircase, hallway! - rooftop
s-e-x non-stop!
see the sceneary! - same postition
my ghetto kama sutra's i'll, now listen!
she flexiable! - i make her do yoga, (yoga!)
twice-a-day i'm bendin' her over. (over)
she-she's my london girl!
my-my-my london giiirl!
she-she's my london giirl!
my-my-my london giiirl!
she-she's my london girl! ( whoo! whatta fuck?)
my-my-my london giiirl!
she-she's my london giirl!
my-my-my london giiirl!
i just came from the usa
now i'm back in the uk!
