"hold me down"
i promise to keep you close to me you give me a sense of security
through drama you will be all i need straight up now i need you to hold me down hold me down
i need you to hold me down hold me down i need you to hold me (down)
through every altercation i'll put no one above you omm omm i love you this shit goes to my truxium
you see how they be lookin' it's frightenin' like lightnin' we crack off they start bookin'
it's beef until i get out in broad day with my shit out that's when i say i'm illin'
and when she get the killin' now my baby she precious i warn not to test this
i am atta head nigga mutha fuck the vestsâ€™ i'm anti-social quit actin' like ya know me

feel the wind blow twist the endo smoke it up it's fundamental you can get to her poke him up
then i fiend her more
when niggaz get the trippin' i need you by my side so that they can't catch me slippin' i take you out shoppin'
