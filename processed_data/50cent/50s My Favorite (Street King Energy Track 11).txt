"50's my favorite (street king energy track #11)"
i took a sip of the potion
lil’ sk, a little goose, now i’m loose
quest for the cheddar i bought shiny beretta
i’m firing squad hard, you niggas should know better
than to bump with ferrari, calamari
i kill like rebels in , i’m sorry
i ball like i think i’m the prince of abu dhabi
black gold gush out the ground
gun powder fly out the pound
i turn a clown smile upside down
that’s 3 time zones in my watch face
still hard to tell time with diamonds all over my watch face
twinkle like i’m outta space, i’m a big dipper
you a little dipper, pipe down little nigga
nice wheels, but don’t talk money, that's what i’m about
i could fit your house inside my house
and your neighbours and ya yard, oh my god
this shit ain't about shit so i ain't gon’ go hard
now kick push, kick push…get the fuck outta here
kick push
you’re now being hypnotised, close your eyes
and say 50′s my favorite, fifty, fifty’s my favorite
i’m not the the one to play with, i mean what i say bitch
50′s my favorite, 50, 50′s my favorite
still on that gutta shit, forever on that gutta shit
50′s my favorite, 50, 50′s my favorite
i know you love that shit, real niggas be loving this
50′s my favorite, 50, 50′s my favorite
oh shit now a nigga floatin’
that luger german, that's kush burning
i’m einstein on the grind
my wheels turning, i’m out in cali not in hollywood
silicon valley, i’m bout to get rich
i mean real rich, i’m talking facebook and spotify type shit
i’m not a programmer, i use ghetto grammar
slang, i’m strong as david banner
the hulk, my money come in bulk
and if this shit go bad, i go back to the dope
and i pay attention to the murder i wrote
this my light shit, my heavy shit on the album
lets get right bitch
