"5 senses"
(feat. jeremih)
i'm a be honest with you, i expect you to like me
i mean what is there not to like?
i'm confident, got a great sense of humor
i'm fun, i-i'm the kind of person you have fun with (hahahahaha)
can you hear me baby?
if it look this good, i wonder how it taste?
baby if i touch your body, hear you scream my name
would you whisper to me it's yours? girl you smell so gentle and pure
you control, my senses. baby all, my senses
it's like everything's good, when i touch and you touch (one)
it smells like heaven, way better than a tulip (two)
your love let me taste it, come here let me taste it (three)
times of the essence baby don't you waste it
i'll tell you what i'm thinking, you'll listen to my thoughts (four)
so you can see my vision, then you'll never get lost (five)
if you follow my lead, girl i'll be what you need
i put my trust in you, now put your trust in me (senses)
if it look this good, i wonder how it taste?
baby if i touch your body, hear you scream my name
would you whisper to me it's yours? girl you smell so gentle and pure
you control, my senses. baby all, my senses
i'll be a true friend, someone to believe in
i'll give you freedom, unconditional meaning
if tonight's her night? it's her night
just get back to me tomorrow, aight?
i'm not into cuffin', i'm not into frontin'
i'm into gettin' paper, blowin' paper, i be stuntin'
see to me it's nothin', let's get into somethin'
should i come pick you up? i'll meet you at the tele girlfriend
would you whisper to me it's yours? girl you smell so gentle and pure
you conrtol, my senses.
if it look this good, i wonder how it taste?
baby if i touch your body, hear you scream my name
would you whisper to me it's yours? girl you smell so gentle and pure
you conrtol, my senses. baby all, my senses
