drunk off my love, call the hennesey thug
passion, ya laughin, i can make you smile on the regular
tell me what you want, shorty, that's what i'ma get ya
yeah, i need you to be what i need, more than liquor or weed
i need you to maybe give me a seed
i need you to give me reason to breathe
i need you, i'm tellin this so you know what i need
i'd be a part-time or full-time lovers, a meant-to-be lover
don't matter which way it go, i'm oh so gutta
girl you could get it however you wan' get it
i'm feelin you, still feelin you right now, get it
i don't play no games (i don't play no games)

come see what i mean (see what i mean)

said lil' mama put me on (baby put me on)
bet i'll have you gone (bet i'll have you gone)
come see what i mean (see what i mean)
