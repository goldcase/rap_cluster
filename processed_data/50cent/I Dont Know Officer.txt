"i don't know officer"
(feat. lloyd banks, ma$e, prodigy, spider loc)
it's 50, it's the unit, that means it's money, ha ha
nah nigga i don't know, i don't know who got you
i don't know who stabbed you, i don't know who shot you
i don't know who cut you, i don't know who robbed you
but you think i know cause you know how my squad do
nowadays niggaz snitchin so much in the street
but you gotta talk to them like they the police
nah, i don't know nothin 'bout poppin the heat
i don't know nothin 'bout sellin no beef in the streets
nah, i don't know nothin 'bout baggin the grams
i ain't never had no spot or went hand to hand
me, i don't know nothin 'bout takin the stand
i ain't never got a nigga ass stuck in the can
nah, i don't know nothin 'bout dro or hash
coke, dope, ex, dust or crystal meth
nah, i'm just tryin to rap to get some cash
keep the hip hop police off my ass
nah nigga i don't know, i don't know who got you
i don't know who stabbed you, i don't know who shot you
i don't know who cut you, i don't know who robbed you
but you think i know cause you know how my squad do
aiyyo, that's my word on the stack of bibles
i don't know who did it i don't know who responsible
all i know who spittin all i know who givin
me all this cash, just to put down twelve to get in yo' ass
listen, keep it far away from me
i ain't got time for sittin in the penitentuary
all i know is i'm rich, all i know is that g-unit work
when theb album drop they go bezerk
mad video play, crazy radio spins
number one all the time, our reign never ends
don't point the finger at us somebody's hangin
they had a beef with us, plus we don't know nathin
nah nigga i don't know, i don't know who got you
i don't know who stabbed you, i don't know who shot you
i don't know who cut you, i don't know who robbed you
but you think i know cause you know how my squad do
i don't know nothin 'bout jumpin out splittin homeboy head
but for real that's fucked up they say that homeboy dead
i can't even think, who 'gon want him dead
have no idea what type of gun they done him with
you see i hear no evil and i see no evil
ain't tryin to talk to or hear from or see those people
and i ain't had them little homies burn up no regal
i've been tryin to do this music thang and just go legal
i don't know why my name in your female's phone
but you really startin to sound like a females homes
don't know why they told you that we sell stones
we on the internet tryin to get our email on
nah nigga i don't know, i don't know who got you
i don't know who stabbed you, i don't know who shot you
i don't know who cut you, i don't know who robbed you
but you think i know cause you know how my squad do
nah nigga i don't know who sent them young boys through
to air the strip, shit just be happenin out the blue
i don't be around here, i ain't hip to the news
i don't know why that man clutchin on that shit when you move
i don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewels
you know how easy it is to get shit confused
i wasn't even in new york, i was just in the cruise
somewhere way out in the islands woth your bitch in the cruise
who's my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze
lose they hit from the uz, uz all over the street
i don't know why they said what's up i don't know who's in that jeep
he talk about me all day but i ain't losin no sleep
nah nigga i don't know, i don't know who got you
i don't know who stabbed you, i don't know who shot you
i don't know who cut you, i don't know who robbed you
but you think i know cause you know how my squad do
i don't know why my charm 'bout as big as your palm
and why the diamond chain i wear as 'bout as long as your arm
you tell me, how many diamonds in my bezel
there's one for everytime i had to grind up in the ghetto
i could show you how to do it, you tired of ridin buicks
i don't know why niggaz rap for years and can't make hotter music
even when, i don't do it chicks release body fluid
body drop, shotty pop, and niggaz wanna tie me to it
i don't know why loon and fabby won't just say i'm they daddy
why they solve them cb4 niggaz just keep comin at me
got as many beefs as 50 and a nigga go to church
could you imagine if my hands was on work, i don't know
nah nigga i don't know, i don't know who got you
i don't know who stabbed you, i don't know who shot you
i don't know who cut you, i don't know who robbed you
but you think i know cause you know how my squad do
