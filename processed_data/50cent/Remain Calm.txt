"remain calm"
(feat. snoop dogg & precious paris)
try to remain calm, you’re fucking with a don
pocket full of green, green in the bong
that bitch with the bow leg stance turning me on
two little timepiece?
niggas still want me dead like osam’
but they ain't gon’ make, they come at me wrong
them niggas all workers i smack the shit out they’re bosses
ferrari, i’m stronger than 5 hundred horses
money is power, you niggas better wake up
my earrings blinking, that’s old shit from jacob
add it up, 4 plus 4 that’s 8 carats
you can’t run and get ya , you ain't got it
blackjack we do that, 10 grand a hand
you could get shot fucking with floyd that’s my man
billionaire brotherhood, we call this the money team
pinky ring flawless, my god i’m gorgeous
remain calm, you’re fucking with a don
remain calm, hoe, remain calm
remain calm, you’re fucking with a don
remain calm, don’t ring the alarm
remain calm, you’re fucking with a don
remain calm, nigga, remain calm
remain calm, you’re fucking with a don
remain calm, this a al qaeda bomb
i’m chillin’ like a villain while i’m dealin’ i am
rulin’ while i’m coolin’ with my tool in my hand
post up, coast up, this is my life bitch
up close only, you’ll get stuck with a knife bitch
cuz burnt out, turnt out like a light switch
got a lot of hoes but charmaine, that’s my white bitch
the rest of my bitches, nah, they ain’t gonna like this
but i don’t give a fuck cause they all love this night stick
but i still remain calm, bang and drop bombs
collar popped up cool as the fonz
motherfucker, have a seat and loosen up
get a glass of some gin now juice it up
deuces up
see there’s a line there for a reason
and if you cross it no more breathin’
you’re leavin’, believe it
we understand each other
cause i would hate to have to put a slug in you brother
ya digg?
with fif’ on that shit, that glock cocked in ya face
my twat cocked in ya face, you know you wan’ taste
alexander mcqueen, strapless with my back out
6 inch givenchy’s and bitch finna act out
niggas on my heels tryna find out what the head like
i know what the bread like
my  headlight, shine like i shine
night or day time
but nah, nana-nah-na
make a nigga walk by, everything i say by
nana-nah-na
get wet i got that comeback
dead crack, my assets is my ass jack
stunt i tell my niggas right where your stash at
you’re fucking with a southside bitch
i go where the money go
i’m at ‘em, i put her on the strobe
get my money hoe
catch me in ferragamo
or dolce & gabbana or
i’m b-squared up, what?
