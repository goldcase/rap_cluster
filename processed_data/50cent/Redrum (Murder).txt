"redrum (murder)"
{"doesn't really matter - us"}
no it don't fuckin matter!
{"doesn't really matter - us"}
we gon' do it my way
{"doesn't really matter - us"}
from here on out it's my way
187 in motion
hammer cocked when i'm coastin, yeah
187 in motion
hammer cocked when i'm coastin
redrum, redrum
fuck with me it'll be murder one
redrum, redrum
one shooter, ten shots, one gun
this is redrum
{"oh it's too late, oh it's too late"}
if i hit him i'll hurt him, i just catch him and murk him
i'm not sittin here waitin for him to come back - naw!
soon as i spot him i got him, i'ma run up and drop him
get that p-90 poppin, nigga hold that - uhh!
i get the gun and they runnin, niggaz know me for dumbin
i got a good reputation, what the fuck can i say
some of these niggaz is bitches, yeah most of 'em snitches
so i don't let 'em know it's me, doin dirt when it's me
i know just how to work it, i can make it go perfect
have the homicides sittin there, scratchin their head
to me a victim's a victim, you could pay me and pick 'em
then i hunt him down and take his head off like i dare ya
i bet you think that i'm vicious, catch you huggin and kissin
while the love's in the air, i put a hole in your heart
plus so now that i'm missin, i'm a fuckin magician
you might find my dna, all over your broad
me and my cannibal methods, i eat you niggaz for breakfast
see the cannon respect it, nigga take off the chain (now!)
robberies turn to murder, i do shit you ain't heard of
change my mind and just pop you, in a blink of an eye
i know you thought i was bluffin, but to me this is nothin
now you can lay there, leakin, go 'head curl up and die
you tell god when you see him, i'll be happy to meet him
i went to service this evenin, he forgives, not i
it's murder
nothin but murder
