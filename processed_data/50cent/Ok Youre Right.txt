"ok, you're right"
okay okay okay
okay okay okay
okay okay okay
okay okay okay
when they talk about me they say i be trippin (yeah)
what they say about me doesn't make me mad (naw, naw)
i think they hatin cause they see me when i'm rollin (yeah)
man i can't help it that they really doin bad (naw, naw)
okay, alright (they sick)
okay, you're right (i'm rich)
okay, alright (i grind)
okay, you're right (for mine)
i'm in that 760 leanin when i'm stuntin
i blow 50 g's, i mean with ease like this is nothin
please don't interrupt me when i'm talkin to my jeweler
he's puttin them diamonds all over my franck muller
me i get busy, i put that work in if it's worth it
come through hit you up, i'll make a crime scene perfect
niggaz talk about me all the time behind my back
they don't talk about me in my face because i'm strapped
see me in the club, i got that henny and that 'gnac
a couple cups of that and i just don't know how to act
by the second bottle that's when i just get to buzzin
i say i run new york and ain't nobody sayin nothin (okay okay okay)
i blew a hundred g's on my bitches in miami
they think i'm the sweetest thing invented since candy
me i catch amnesia when you ask me 'bout the shotty
i don't even know my name, switchin lanes in my bugatti
nigga i ain't crazy, bitches like me cause i'm paid
they want me, lebron, kobe or dwyane wade
when i say i'm ballin i'm not talkin 'bout a ball
i'm talkin 'bout tiffany & co. stones out the mall
niggaz they can hate all they want but they know they like this
me i'm like that paintin on the wall, baby i'm priceless
you could come and work me over baby on the night shift
catch me on the night shift, see how freaky i get (okay okay okay)
okay okay okay okay - sho' you right
okay okay okay okay - you know you right
okay, alright, okay, alright
okay, alright, okay, you're right
