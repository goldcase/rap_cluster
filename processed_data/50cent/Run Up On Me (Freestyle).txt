"run up on me (freestyle)"
this is the unit bitch
nigga this is ground hog day
back to buying toasters
i'm i'll, no doc, no diagnosis
no cure, i smell fear
nigga my eyes don't cry, my heart so cold
let's play, let's make a deal nigga, sell me your soul
got a fetish for the guns, calico drums
rap meyer lansky steady counting my ones
death dealer, heron, meth dealer
top biller, point blank, i'm that nigga
barrell smokin', fiend smokin', rims pokin'
out on that 550 benz, bitch is open
inhale, exhale, feel a different high
andrew mcqueen shirt and jeans, this a different fly
presidential time, nigga watch the rolie shine
no need for pens and paper, this is, what's on my mind
i don't suggest you play boy
i don't think you should fuck with me
i'll shoot right away boy
find out when you run up on me
i'm riding with that k boy
i put that on my dead homies
i spray it right away boy
find out when you run up on me
when niggas shot me, i must have bled out my conscience
go 'head play boy, i bang that thing at you like bronson
i feel for you niggas i'm back now
i told you pussy niggas '03 i don't back down
me still a rookie, nah, i'm more like veteran
i bet ya ipod is full of niggas i'm better than
magician i make grams turn to cash, kush turn in to ash
heads turn into ass, i'm the bum nigga of the class
that's me in a nutshell, run tell i did it
interrogation hours go on, i won't admit it
got cash coming out of my ass, i'm so compelling
these niggas act hard till you hit 'em, they start tellin'
i don't suggest you play boy
i don't think you should fuck with me
i'll shoot right away boy
find out when you run up on me
i'm riding with that k boy
i put that on my dead homies
i spray it right away boy
find out when you run up on me
