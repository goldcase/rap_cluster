"planet 50"
(feat. jeremih)
if he's your number one, and he's your everything
why would you pick up the phone when i call to talk to me?
you know you won't play with a nigga
i fly out to spend the day with a nigga
first flight, first seat and first class
first pair of giuseppes, first birkin bag
i'm street king, so you'll be fit for a king
when we step out on the scene it's alexander mcqueen
it's a ghetto fairy tale, i'll be your knight in shining armor
and retro jordan's, giselle's and a leather bomber
bright lights, city life, i'll show around new york a bit
from hot dogs and pretzels to the expensive shit
cause we can shop till my nickname saks fifth
madison ave mindframe, baby i stack chips smile
me cell phone'll capture the moment
when your emotions start to shift
i'm a just shoot that over your brown eyes
to chocolate thighs
make me wanna sin good lord
is this adam and eve happening again?
we could get all day, all night, twisted up, get right
let me know if you're with it
that kush in my hood so good, roll it up, back wood
can't wait to let you hit it
now you're in my world
now you're in my world!
planet fifty
listen shawty, this is my foreplay without the touching
you can say it's my fort√©, i feel you coming
mindsex i make you wanna take your clothes off
2020  benz, i'm feeling that concept
i want the best, now can you be the best for me
can my vision and your ambition make the perfect recipe
let's take a walk on the wild side and chat til your body language is saying, boy come get this cake
in my mind ten times, i done took off your clothes
so if you're thinking what i'm thinking, let me know it's a go
i'm a gambling man, talking 'bout life not dicing
and that look in your eyes say it's going down tonight
you can show me what you're into
as i get into, kissing, licking, switching positions
acting like a nympho
round after round, i show you how i put it down
jet set, mile high club
