"man's world"
what you sayin boy, boy? (boy)
ha ha! said what you sayin boy, boy? (boy)
see, the weak get walked on, the soft get barked on
see me, i never ever ever runnnn
niggaz say the wrong shit to me, like he wan' do me
somebody lead him with my gunnnn
what you sayin boy? you think i'm playin boy?
watch your mouth girl, this a man's world
what you sayin boy? you think i'm playin boy?
watch your mouth girl, this a man's world
listen nigga you play me, and i'ma go crazy
you push me i'ma motherfuckin trip
i come trippin through yo' set, bustin off my tec
i gives a fuck if you's a blood or a crip
nigga from j.f.k. to l.a.x. i'm back through the sets again
gangsta life that's right, crazy-ass mexicans
do it the raw way, broad day, ak
spray cause a melee, mayday mayday!
freak bitch suck me on tape like ray j
niggaz that i'm up against know they can't fade me
i'm the last one, you know the last don
she know she wan' come, bitch bring ya ass on!
see i come from the southside where niggaz is outside
right now with the rubber grips
niggaz say they gon' see me, to hit 'em on g.p.
then i bless 'em with the chains full of bricks
when you come from where i'm from, you come from the bottom
they ain't supposed to get this rich
so the fed's got my phone tapped to treat me like fat cat
now i'm thinkin "man ain't this a bitch!"
niggaz stick cola in cola, from movin the yola
next thing you know they up in yo' crib
sayin where's the stash at? you move they gon' blast that
so i suggest you stand still kid
this a man's world...
watch your mouth girl, this a man's world
