tuck da nine by my spine all the time
stunt when i want a dead nigga fuck wit mine
my neck and my ear get to flickin like a strobe
my wrist and my whips have niggas like whoa
i'm the underground king i reside on the throne
in the club wylin out over henny and patron

it's bottle after bottle til g-stacks are blown
shawty in my ear like please take me home
before the next song come on dawg we gone
off to the hotel, motel, the holiday inn

yea they want more they hot and they want more
they love the way i kick it they addicted to ya boy

i have ya in the mornin like a dope fiend sick
now feel the rush i'm like pure cocaine
i have the whole night club goin insane
no matter how rich i get i'm never gonna change
