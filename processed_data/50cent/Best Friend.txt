"best friend"
yeah! it's my tape man, listen to my tape
woo!!!
if i was your best friend, i want you 'round all the time (i want you 'round me all the time)
can i be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (girl promise you'll be mine)
please say he's just a friend (uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (come on)
either he is or he ain't your man (ha ha!) please say he's just a friend
if i was your best friend, i want you 'round all the time (i want you 'round me all the time)
can i be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (girl promise you'll be mine)
please say he's just a friend (uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (come on)
either he is or he ain't your man (ha ha!) please say he's just a friend
if i was your best friend
first we get the talkin, then we get the touchin
if we get pass the phone games we'll be fuckin
i kiss like the french therefore my tongue in your ear
do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
for me a different scenery just mean a different position
in the tub or on the sink i improvise now listen
in the chopper or on the jet join the mile high club
i'm no fool i know money can't buy me love
but i'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
see i see somethin special when i look in your eyes
with your legs way back i see this pussy is mine
if you ain't sure when i'm talkin i don't tell you no lies
but there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
when i don't say what i'm thinkin it don't mean that i'm shy
got on that shit you picked out for me that's why i'm so fly
if i was your best friend, i want you 'round all the time (i want you 'round me all the time)
can i be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (girl promise you'll be mine)
please say he's just a friend (uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (come on)
either he is or he ain't your man (ha ha!) please say he's just a friend
if i was your best friend, i want you 'round all the time (i want you 'round me all the time)
can i be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (girl promise you'll be mine)
please say he's just a friend (uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (come on)
either he is or he ain't your man (ha ha!) please say he's just a friend
if i was your best friend
while you in your bubble bath i'll come wash on your back
when you puttin on your lotion i can help you with that
i sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
or slang i use when we build may change how you talk
and if i'm focused while i'm strokin i could change how you walk
there's a swagger that you calm but when you come from new york
i'm a hustler i just hustle in the things that i bought
separate me from the rest, i feel like i'm the best
if there's a price to pay for feelin you i pay that twice
i'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
i ain't got nothin to hide baby i tell you my secrets
'fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
i get closer to you, i mean closer than close
i get into you, after i take off my clothes
girl i been into you, mentally long before
if i was your best friend, i want you 'round all the time (i want you 'round me all the time)
can i be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (girl promise you'll be mine)
please say he's just a friend (uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (come on)
either he is or he ain't your man (ha ha!) please say he's just a friend
if i was your best friend, i want you 'round all the time (i want you 'round me all the time)
can i be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (girl promise you'll be mine)
please say he's just a friend (uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (come on)
either he is or he ain't your man (ha ha!) please say he's just a friend
if i was your best friend
