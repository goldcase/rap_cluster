50 cent lyrics
"what if"
yeah
im fuckin with this..
its that classic shit..
that gangster shit..
yeah..
man i watch the sun go up and come down
sayin.. what if?
man i watch the tide roll in and roll out
sayin.. what if?
homie i play the block tryna get my packs off
sayin.. what if?
man if i get a shot, i can make it to the top
damn.. what if?
if i got on some pretty boy shit like puffy
niggaz in the hood man they jus wouldnt love me
if i wore a suit everyday like jay-z
niggaz would think i bumped my fuckin head and went crazy
if i put diamonds in my teeth like baby
i wouldnt stand a chance of tryin to sell like shady
if i put out bullshit joints like az
every chance niggaz get they try n play me
but i move around with a lil 3.80
a nigga try to stunt, a nigga get sprayed b
if i smoke weed all day like snoop do
i see the world different through my dialated pupils
if i buss dance moves on ya like usher
niggaz would say 50 that aint gangster, fuck ya
man ima just keep doin' what i do..
cuz niggaz cant do me better than i do
man i watch the sun go up and come down
sayin.. what if?
man i watch the tide roll in and roll out
sayin.. what if?
homie i play the block tryna get my packs off
sayin.. what if?
man if i get a shot, i can make it to the top
damn.. what if?
what if i had blockbuster slips like will smith
and all the backpack niggaz love me like mos def
i probably be a cool ass nigga like ice cube
picture me in the flick right now lookin' so cool
what if i was a low-key nigga just laid back
hustle to keep a homie around somebody to hold a gat
man what if halle berry was my nex baby momz
shit i get that child support up with no problem
if i caught a case and jump bail like ??get caught??
cuz im that nigga everybody know from new york
what if i was a new rap nigga you didnt know
you be sayin damn that kid got a sick flow
but if i just cruise through your hood on 22's
bumpin curtis mayfield and marvin "so smooth"
and if i let the top down on the azure
yeah that'd make you sick to your stomach, im sure
haha..
man i watch the sun go up and come down
sayin.. what if?
man i watch the tide roll in and roll out
sayin.. what if?
homie i play the block tryna get my packs off
sayin.. what if?
man if i get a shot, i can make it to the top
damn.. what if?
