"get it hot"
(feat. lloyd banks)
i get down, i get down, i get down (yeah, yeah)
i get down, i get down (i like the way that sounds)
i get down, i get down, i get down (yeah, yeah)
i get down, i get down
get it get it get it hot hot hot hot hot
get it get it get it hot hot hot hot hot
get it get it get it hot
oh i think she like me, hell yeah she like me
my watch game crazy, audemar's so icy
she like it when i stunt, me i'm what she want
i'm in that rich nigga fraternity, we only talk bread (get it get it get it)
got money out the asshole, the money on my head
don't mean nothin, i said don't mean nothin (get it get it get it)
the rose in the rover i'm drinkin and i'm drivin
that nigga try and get at me i'm pullin out and firin
to see if i'm stuntin, the piece it ain't nothin
royal fees ain't nothin, i just blow a lil' somethin
now shorty got a thing for me she feel like i'm the shit
my guess is i'm the kind of nigga she wanna be with
hot hot hot hot hot
get it get it get it hot hot hot hot hot
get it get it get it hot
(she want me, yeah yeah, she want me)
(she want me, why you think she on me?)
get it get it get it hot hot hot hot hot
get it get it get it hot hot hot hot hot
get it get it get it hot
(she want me, yeah yeah, she want me)
(she want me, why you think she on me?)
get it get it get it
i'm a substitute teacher, welcome to sex ed.
she'll be an a student time she get out my bed
i'm flashy, i'm rollin with the stones
get at me, i'm movin with the chrome (get it get it get it)
a made man, a don corleone
no matter where i'm at i'm doin what the fuck i want
i'm shinin, my wrists all canary
now try me, i keep a shooter near me
i'm grindin, like i ain't made my first mil'
like i ain't signed a first deal, like i ain't at the first meal
i'm hungry, i really want it all
now watch me, i'll show you how to ball (get it get it get it)
life in the fast lane, fast car fast cash
freak bitch, fast ass (get it get it get it)
i'm where the money at mayne, fast on the draw
fast runnin from the law (get it get it get it)
she like the bad boys, the bad boys
the bad boys (get it get it get it)
she like the bad boys, the bad boys
the bad boys (get it get it get it)
get it get it get it
get it get it get it
get it get it get it
