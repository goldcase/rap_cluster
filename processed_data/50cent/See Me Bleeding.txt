"see me bleeding"
they wanna see me bleeding
when the times get harder,
i grind harder from the bottom soles of my feet
they wanna see me bleeding
my blood's always thicker than water
even tho,the waters run deep
they wanna see me bleeding
through tha pain, i just grit my teeth
through the flames i just take on the heat.
through my vains runs the heart of the street
ain't nothing change i’m a stay on my g`s
so what they want from me? they wanna see me bleeding.
how did i get in here, life is a livin hell.
the walls are closing in it feels like i'm trapt in prison cell
they pray for me to fail
but in my face they wish me well
but still i persevere
deal with hand i was dealt
they neva gave me nothing every thing i got myself
so they cant tell me nothing still they all in my grill
try to claim that they real
try to tell me they love me
but noone was ever there
they wanna see me bleeding
i never been scared
there ain't nothing i fear
look in my eyes and u can see the soul of a man
they just don't understand
i walk with my gun in my hand i bust up in the air
give niggas a runnin chance
a soldier in the trinchez a wreisel in the fire
see i'm that young nigga og's hate to admire
its the hate that inspires
my love for getting rich and im'a die tryin.
they wanna see me bleeding
when times get harder,
i grind harder from the bottom souls of my feet
they wanna see me bleeding
my blood's always thicker than water
even tho,the waters run deep
they wanna see me bleeding
through tha pain, i just grit my teeth
through the flames i just take on the heat.
through my vains runs the heart of the street
ain't nothing changed i’m a stay on my g`s
so what they want from me? they wanna see me bleeding.
man i'm ready to ride
why they want me to die
they wanna live my life
i can see the hate in they eyes
somebody tell me why
when i look in the sky
he don't ever look down
i guess that he don't hear my cries
please show me a sign
that i got enough time
to get outta the grind
a gettin' in the shine
i’m tryn to hold it down
but i ain't worried man,what goes around comes around
they wanna see me bleeding
my backs against the wall
niggaz is all talk come on talk no bite niggaz is all bark
i'm the light in the dark
i ignite like a spark
the pimpin in me will never die preach what mama told ya
go an get what u want and remember the south cause u never know where you goin if you don't know where your from
so i lifted the trunk and chunked the deuce sideways break them boys off
they wanna see me bleeding
when times get harder,
i grind harder from the bottom souls of my feet
they wanna see me bleeding
my blood's always thicker than water
even tho,the waters run deep
they wanna see me bleeding
through tha pain, i just grit my teeth
through the flames i just take on the heat.
through my vains runs the heart of the street
ain't nothing changed i’ma stay on my g`s
so what they want from me? they wanna see me bleeding.
nanananananaaaaaaa (yeahh)
they wanna see me bleeding
nanananananaaaaaaa (uh huh)
they wanna see (come on) me bleeding
nanananananaaaaaaaa
everything ain't what it seems
take a look at wat i see
one eye on the prize the other on my enemies
they wanna see me bleeding
when times get harder,
i grind harder from the bottom souls of my feet
they wanna see me bleeding
my blood's always thicker than water
even tho,the waters run deep
they wanna see me bleeding
through tha pain, i just grit my teeth
through the flames i just take on the heat.
through my vains runs the heart of the street
ain't nothing change i’m a stay on my g`s
so what they want from me? they wanna see me bleeding.
nanananananaaaaa, nanananananaaaaa nanananananaaaaa
