50 cent lyrics
"doo wop freestyle"
aiyo, i know these niggas don't like me
but i don't like none of ya'll niggas, you know what i'm sayin
50 cent, 9-9, motherfuckin doo wop
volume 3, take it however the fuck you wan' take it
faggot ass niggas (50 cent show these niggas how to rock)
yo, they done shot that boy down like a dog in the street
left him smelly, man fuck that, roll em over take that fellas pellet
you ain't never heard a motherfucker spit like this
not even puff, and that nigga there made crazy hits
every few years a nigga come who crazy hot
i'm the next best thing since biggie and pac
now i'm sayin this shit slow, so you don't miss it
don't be a statistic, my jewels from the district
stay with my biscuit, touch mines and get twisted
son i'm off the meter, my mind locked on crime
see i'm tired of all these rappin niggas dyin to shine
and i'm tired of fiends askin for a dime for nine
hearing this next punch line from me, may sound strange
you sit your 5-dollar ass down, before i make change
yo the sale went stale, caught em real bad
fresh out the jail, shit is really real
niggas is still in jail, and i pray they don't tell
20-man inditement, my lawyer gotta fight this
niggas know, i ain't never pressed for dough
and niggas know, i don't serve nobody i don't know
son said he was from o.t., pay 11 an o.z.
my man brought em to me, see he ain't really know b
that it was hot, dude was a cop
he was just tryin to pop, to put the new beams on his drop
first i served him o.z.'s, then i served him whole keys
now we all co-de's, damn man i o.d.
you know how it is on the street, niggas is holdin the heat
po-po walking to beat, we burnin l's up in the jeep
ain't nothing sweet, we used to move so strategic
it's over i can't believe it, damn it's over
fed's ceased the six, the lex' and the range rover
now a nigga rollin in a toyota corolla
used to never get high, now i'm never sober
380-6 shot glock top load-up
keep it in my waist son, i'll put one in your face
i ain't got nothing to lose, nigga so stay in your place
just jumped bail, i ain't been on the run long
but it feel like a motherfuckin marathon
