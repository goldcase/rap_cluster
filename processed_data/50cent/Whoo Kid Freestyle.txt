"whoo kid freestyle"
(feat. g-unit (uncredited))
yo this is 50 cent, yaknawsayin?
i'm here with my man whoo kid, you know how i put it down nigga
it's not safe around here as soon as the street lights
g-unit nigga
we can't get money selling weed...we gon sell coke
ain't no money sellin' coke... we gon sell dope
ain't no money sellin' dope... we gon sell x
and if niggaz wont by the x... we gon sell tecs
my advice for y'all niggaz is stop frontin
'cause 50 say pop somethin', i'm gon pop somethin', what up?
don't make me send a nigga to you, 16 shot ruger
send twelve shots to you, run four in the clip
get in the whip, it's a wrap
nah fuck that
man, you done hit the nigga twice in the head, that's that
niggaz running with the steel out, now it's time to peel out
50 let me drive
nah i got this, nigga chill out
it'd be nice to get the niggaz ice, get it, give it back
just get in the corner store cause it's full of them a-rabs
they blowin' the shit up like it's okay
i got a bomb on my waist i'm kamikaze
i dare ds to get next to me
or a nigga to creep up and put a tec to me
yeah, yeah that's it, it's a freestyle
the fuck you want for free?
fucking a-rabs just ran the planes into the fucking building
coke price went up 10 grand this fucking week
