"straight to the bank"
yeah!!! when i'm out in n.y. boy it's blunts and phillies
when i'm out in l.a. boy it's wraps and swishes
now blood walk to this, now crips walk to this
now throw it up, raise it up for that gangster shit
now blood walk to this, now crips walk to this
now throw it up, raise it up for that gangster shit
i'm in my lambo maggot, my fo' fo' faggot
doors lift up i'm like go go gadget
see the shit i got on, homey i hate too
my teflon arm brought my government issues
i'll hit your vertebrate bullets rip through tissues
your wife on the futon hugging that shitsu
homey you a bitch you got feminine ways
heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
i got fo' fifths and bananas on the k's
and got more whips than a runaway slave
me and yayo go back like some high top fades
when i made fifty mill, em got paid
when i made sixty mill, dre got paid
when i made eighty mill, jimmy got paid
i ain't even gotta rap now life is made
said i ain't even gotta rap, i'm filthy mayne
i'm laughing straight to the bank with this (ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
i'm laughing straight to the bank with this (ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
i'm laughing straight to the bank with this (ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
i'm laughing straight to the bank with this (ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
i'm laughing
i see nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
i got the kind of money that the bank can't hold
got it off the street moving bundles and loads
seventy three caprice old school when i roll
breeze pass with the ez pass fuck the toll
no more platinum i'm wearing gold
i'm internationally known as the kid with the flow
that brings enough dough it's never enough dough
shit i need mo' i need shit out the sto'
baby ble was cold fresh out the flo'
stashbox by the dashbox in case they want war
make the purple bring the green in fuck the law
i'm oh so raw, i'm hot i'm sure
i'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe boy
i set the club on fire i told ya
i'm the general salute me soldier
i'm laughing straight to the bank with this (ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
i'm laughing straight to the bank with this (ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
i'm laughing straight to the bank with this (ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
i'm laughing straight to the bank with this (ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)
i'm laughing
now work it out now, shorty work it out, work it out
i wanna see you, break it down
now back it up now, you know what i'm about
it's like a bank job i'm in and i'm out
now work it out now, work it out, work it out
now work it out now, work it out, work it out
