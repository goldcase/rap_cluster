"girls go wild"
(feat. jeremih)
(give it to 'em)
give it to 'em
don't do much talking, i just check 'em with the d
got 'bout 3, 4 bad, bad bitches in the tub waiting for me
oh, my favorite so damn cold, her name elise
say she got a man, but she can't stand that he's a zero
bitch, i'm the man, i love her belief
bet she catch her hands, all all over me
yeah, gon roll up a leaf
get you high as nasa, carefull with ya asses
i only want bad (give it to 'em)
whatever on tab (give it to 'em)
i'm a spend a little more change at the bar,
tell the dj to run it back
give it to 'em
give it to 'em
give it to 'em
(give it to 'em)
50 cent got that shit that made them "girls go wild, girls go wild"
my shit knock in the club and it make them "girls go wild, girls go wild"
from the front to the back let me kick it "girls go wild, girls go wild"
i got them macking like they're rocking to my old shit "girls go wild, girls go wild"
she want me to trick, i think this pussy one for me
she seen my watch and all the rocks on top of my new pinky ring
understand i'm out here in these street
get out of line tryin' to take mine
i get at you with the heat, boy
girl, my swag is i'll, friends i blew a couple g's
shorty bad, i bet ya she's a freak
she might bring a friend if she want something to eat
i know they want that (give it to 'em)
whatever on tab (give it to 'em)
i'm a spend a little more change at the bar,
tell the dj to run it back
give it to 'em
give it to 'em
give it to 'em
(give it to 'em)
50 cent got that shit that made them "girls go wild, girls go wild"
my shit knock in the club and it make them "girls go wild, girls go wild"
from the front to the back let me kick it "girls go wild, girls go wild"
i got them macking like they rocking to my old shit "girls go wild, girls go wild"
smoke purple shit and it slow me down, down, down
i sip brown shit 'till my head spin round, round, round
shorty says she wants me, you know what's up
might pop a pill before we fuck
basicly we all turned up, all the way turned up
first it's fifty you know you so strong,
that it's 'tell me how you go so long? '
non-stop, please can we take a break
she said "i need water, i need water"
i don't need no crowd round when i'm performing,
no tv, no lights, no camcorder
i let the world know i'm a bedroom star
ya boy a freak, i always go hard
i only want bad (give it to 'em)
whatever on tab (give it to 'em)
i'm a spend a little more change at the bar,
tell the dj to run it back
give it to 'em
give it to 'em
give it to 'em
