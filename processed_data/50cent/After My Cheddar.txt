"after my cheddar"
aye what's up
yo this is 50 cent and i'm here with my man dj on point
and you know why his name is on point cuz he on point pussy
go 'head play that shit i'll lay ya fucking punk ass out nigga
when you frown at me (yeah!)
is it cuz i won't provide for you girl? (cuz i won't provide)
you're after my cheddar (haha)
and your friends they see it too (c'mon)
spending notes is what your up to (is this what you want??)
women are after my cheddar
(is this what you want?!)
i gave you a style, gucci this fendi that (yeah)
burberry bag, shoes and the hat to match (aha)
i like the way it look but bitch i ain't buying that
i hate to be the bearer of bad news
but no more prada shoes (uh!)
when i just wanna chill you wanna go out (woo!)
see me poly with some other chick you wanna show out
they say i'm wrong when i dog your ass like i should
now you can reminisce on the times i treated you good
you could think about me grinding my fans (yeah!)
you even got more than one watch on it's too much time on your hands (aha)
they say behind every good man is a woman (woo!)
so if tash pull up stash the cannon in your linnen (c'mon)
i'll never be a chouffer to the mall
so learn to appreciate the cd's and posters on the wall
fatal attraction is mad real
the last bitch i deaded went crazy and swallowed thirty advils
they say money makes the world go 'round
and material things make a hoe go down (fuh sho'!)
i see you in your prada, gucci, and bcbg (aha)
bitch i'm getting rich but i don't trick on gp (yeah)
it's $5 dresses and $10 skirts
bitch play the strip and put in work (woo!)
birds wanna have my baby since i saw my contract
so i gotta double up in case the condom snap
look, don't ask me for shit, man
i ain't got nothing for you, man
yo, what? bitch what the fuck you mean i can't sing, bitch?
bitch, i'm luther vandross in the shower
