"they burn me"
look at what they did to me, they burned me,
they turned me, into an animal, they flipped, son they burned me,
to the first degree me,
son they hurt me, i looked out for them motherfuckers they burned me,
i was good now i'm bad, see they done turned me, into a monster,
i can't believe they burned me, i showed them love they showed me hate,
they burned me, now i'm heartless, your pain don't concern me.
i got so many enemies, so many memories,
so many flashbacks, we used to be friends,
sugar turned to shit, people just change,
they keep pushing a nigga to that hammer go bang,
you violate, i will let that motherfucker rang,
feels like, money came and more money came, and
niggas start foaming out the mouth growin fangs,
now, when did i become the savior of the hood,
look homie, u don't know me, i wouldn't save you if i could,
i sacrifice for suckas and they change me, i'm angry
they selfish, all they want is what they want so they blame me, (wow)
like it's all my fault they ain't caked up,
you a grown ass man, damn when you gon wake up,
turn 7 to 14, 14 to 28, i owned a 62, nigga get up your weight,
learn how to dump the jake, stack the paper then you straight.
i tried to help a nigga eat, man it's hard out on the street,
cuz i'm kind they think i'm weak (they burn me)
they see the way i grind, and they like the way i shine,
they want paper like mine (they burn me)
man they be on some shit when they tryin to hit a lick,
man a motherfucker flip, (so they burn me)
you think they won't trip cuz you helped them from the rip,
they ain't loyal to shit.
she called the cops on me cuz i don't love her like i used to,
tried to fix what was wrong, gets it hurts cuz i'm gone,
my son, he loves me but she tryin to poison his mind,
actin like everything they got ain't come from my grind,
i said a prayer for her like, "god please change her heart,
all this hatred at one time is tearing me apart"
man i ain't lookin for trouble, i'm lookin for blessings,
but ever since the money came, me i've been stressing,
got my ass kicked for being kind, i can't trust nobody,
the closer they get to me, the more they take from me,
man, i'm givin all i got to give, i'm tryin to live,
they look at me, their eyes got dollar signs, they want the kid...
to give it all up, fall apart, break down, i ain't got much left, what they wanna take now,
my life, i got so much more to offer, i'ma make them watch me be number one till i'm done, yeah
i tried to help a nigga eat, man it's hard out on the street,
cuz i'm kind they think i'm weak (they burn me)
they see the way i grind, and they like the way i shine,
they want paper like mine (they burn me)
man they be on some shit when they tryin to hit a lick,
man a motherfucker flip, (so they burn me)
you think they won't trip cuz you helped them from the rip,
they ain't loyal to shit.
they burn me all the way down,
betray me just because i'm down,
i don't know what to do now,
me, my loyalty is what i'm bout. (haha)
(they burn me) over and over and over, like they doin what they supposed to,
(they burn me) goddamn look at how they do me, somebody new tryin to sue me.
(so they burn me)....
