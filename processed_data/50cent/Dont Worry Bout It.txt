"don't worry 'bout it"
(feat. yo gotti)
don't worry 'bout how i get my money, bitch, just know i get my money
don't worry 'bout i spend my money, boy, i got a lot
don't worry 'bout that car i drive, don't worry 'bout that bike i ride
don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch
don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
don't worry 'bout a mothafuckin' thing
don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
we got a strap up in here if niggas playing
when time pass and i'm not around, niggas saying i'm out of town
probably moving them bricks around, they swear they know how i get down
don't worry 'bout what i'm doing, don't worry 'bout what i'm doing
my closet full of that fly shit, black card when i buy shit
sell the shit you get high with, these niggas on my dick
don't worry 'bout what i'm doing, don't worry 'bout what i'm doing
that's your bitch, i understand, i've seen it all on instagram
i'm just from the past, i done been all in that ass
don't worry 'bout what i'm doing, don't worry 'bout what i'm doing
don't be worry 'bout my record deals cause i still got my plug
don't be worry 'bout my bitch pimping, she get money out that club
don't be worry 'bout my partners and 'em, we get money, we eating
you talk shit 'bout a real nigga, bitch, you must be tweaking
don't be worried 'bout my whereabouts, money all i care about
keeping it real in my neighborhood, play with me and i'mma air it out
why you worry 'bout my money, nigga? bitch, you think i'm broke?
the fed worry 'bout what i'm doing, think i'm selling dope
i may be and i may not, go to jail i may rot
i ain't never gon' snitch, nigga, never been no bitch nigga
i got big guns, need a extra large, y'all niggas got question marks
talking down on a real nigga, that's how you get a hater charged
don't worry 'bout what they talking 'bout
don't tell me what that bitch done said
i'm done with her, you can go with her
i'm leaving here with another bitch
don't worry 'bout how they look at me
my diamonds on, damn, look at me
these pussy nigga be shooked at me
wanna judge and throw the book at me
don't worry 'bout it, i ain't worried 'bout it
had time to talk to my legal team
don't worry 'bout it, i ain't worried 'bout it
ain't shit they could do to me
still rocking, still rolling
we holding, bill folding, you know it
when i start to ball out money start to fall out
throw it up, it fall out the sky
baddest bitches go all out, whole bar get bought out
that's what i call my lifestyle
