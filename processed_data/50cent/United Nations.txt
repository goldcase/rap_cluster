pop a x then a blue pill then wreck a bitch
i like it raw; ooh baby ohh baby i like it raw
take a chill pill bright and early tomorrow
the morning after, plan b, no kids involved

i put that money in a vault bitch, usain bolt quickness
but let's make a deal then blow mil's for real
uh, time's a-wastin, you're watchin my watch, huh?
you're old school, huh? you're jockin my style, uhh

motherfuck an award, check forbes i'm there
not once, e-ve-ry year!
even when i take a break my pockets is in shape

they thought i'm goin down now look i'm levitatin

in somalia and kenya with united nations
fundin the world food programme
i'm fin' to solve world hunger, goddamn!
