50 cent lyrics
"bump dat street mix"
new shit
tony yayo, 50 cent c'mon
bump dat
niggas try to stunt on my click
then when i get on that shit
i bring it to 'em where they pump at
12 gauge mashberg
no shell in the head
before you put in work, you gotta pump that
you done hit a nigga with it and you runnin to polices
come and take my advice, nigga, dump that
this is serious, these rap niggas, i'm just havin fun with it
50 cent, nigga, bump dat
my son ask "daddy why carry a gun, you ain't a cop"
looked at him and said "sometimes you gotta shoot or get shot"
wanna go to show-and-tell and show the class my glock?
show 'em the clip
show 'em the beam
show 'em how daddy lean
in the convertible jag
22 inch mags
for a high school drop out, shit, that ain't bag
i'm not a blood or a crip, i'm doing my own thang
g-unit
shit, i done started my own gang
i don't go that funny dance
i don't throw gang signs
but i'm a gangsta to the core so i stay with a nine
think all i do is rap, then you don't know me good
have smurf hangin out the sun roof to light up your hood, man
cause lethal ain't never seen blaco comin'
but if he did .. you think he woulda started runnin?
and i move with the doublemint twins and two macs
and leave you flat your back
brrat
take that
i gotta half a mil deal with no diploma
ice so blind it give your ass glaucoma
its hard to live, but its easy to die
so i'm going through life lookin death in the eye
these rappers ain't gun slingers
they r&b singers
g-unit, come thru with some guerilla niggas
minimum wage ain't gonna pay the rent
cause the seats in the coupe got the fendi print
and this shit right here for the listeners pleasure
i'm still on the strip with the fifth and my ever
its t-o-n-y
stay with a semi
milk your crack spot - till the shit be bone dry
you think you pump hard?  nigga i pump harder
my phone ring so much, i walk around with the charger
when the d's come around, i'ma swallow my crack
shit the work out later, and hit 'em with that
if it's a direct sale
i'ma change the bill
tryin to push the new range cause they changed the grille
look nigga we icey thugs
we stay with them things so we stay with some nike gloves
just havin fun with this rap shit, man
it never stops
my man 50 done put out, what, three albums on the street?
and y'all ain't even hear the new shit
just keep goin' and goin' and goin'
motherfuckin' duracell battery
it never stops
word up
g-unit
sha money xl
