"blue sky"
mr. blue sky, please tell us
(listen) why you had to hide away for
aston martin king, luther with dreams
the young denzel the way i move through scenes
i’m like a preacher that once was a fiend
a story of change that came with wings
pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eye line
son of the most so from up high i shine
suited in prada, stay mellow like lala
young fresh with dollars, ladies go gaga
i’m the cum lauda, top of the class
black wall street so my stock will never crash
given what i ask, pure religion and cash
from the windows that open, i’m raising my glass
day light beams, night light schemes
this is my inception, i’m writing my dreams
immortal view of a star doing what i’m born to do
i see the blue sky, say the lord’s coming through
oh-oooh-oh, in the sky we’ll find the light
oh-oooh-oh, ain’t too high we’ll shine at night
now we in the skies, blue skies
and we going higher, last night
it all started with a dream, i wanted to be run d.m.c
the lord put the blessing upon the mc
o to the m, dreams were spoken to him
that’s when i knew my flows would overflow to the rim
open my eyes, yes sir this is what i’m made for
to go hard in the paint like d. wade or
d. rose, from the same streets that we rose
international heroes at world premo’s
red carpet, imagine taking pictures with the president
told him for health care, my music is the medicine
my name holds weight, i am never hesitant
different state resident, this is hood elegance
sls classic, pursuing my passion
known for fashion, now i’m oscar party crashing
immortal view of a star doing what i’m born to do
i see the blue sky, say the lord’s coming through
silhouettes of dreams that we had huh
even now it don’t seem so bad ma
close my eyes to see things in front of me
i’m gone now, imagine what i’m gonna be
30 to worthy, now i’m all worldly
my broad up in paris, looking all purrty
immortal view of a star doing what i’m born to do
i see the blue sky, say the lord’s coming through
i had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
i could see it from my window
wouldn’t take that long to get me there
keep running 'til i can’t go
remember the beautiful things that life could give me
crazy how i’m the one
could’ve been anywhere, but i’m sitting in the air
with the wolves up staring at the sun
ohh, in the sky we’ll find the light
ohh, ain’t too high we’ll shine at night
no we in the skies, blue skies
and we going higher, last night
