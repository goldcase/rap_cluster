"sweet"
you know they be asking ’bout common, where he at?
i’m doing what i do, hip hop, thats what i do
yeah
how can i say this, fuck it i’m the greatest
i am the a-list for all these great debaters
a lot of ya’ll nah nah, forgot na, who i am
the ’87 nigga used to rah rah in the jam
ow yeah, we put them things in the air
when i drop a single, it’s really like a pair
of air jordans, important to the culture
if you aint true to it, callate la boca
get my drink on like a coaster
post up on a wall, a mic, used to live off
hip hop master cleanse, i’mma get my shit off
rollin’ in a maserati gran with the lid off
i bit off like a monster, live nigga this is my encore
encore, encore, i rhyme for the commoners
my name synonymous with prominence
i’m to hip hop what obama is to politics
common is
yeah, man, y’all niggas man, you soft muthfuckers
yeah my man, muthafcker
then come around my crib
you know where i’m from
some hoes ass niggas
singing all around me man, la la la
you aint muthafucking frank sinatra
uh, lil bitch
yeah, this the raw right here
yeah this the raw right here nigga
sweet muthafuckas
sweet ass bitch muthafucka
wa da da da, wa dada dada da
the c-o double-m o-n, i’m not playin’
da da man at work, i make my own lane
i’m the franchise so i rock my own chain
no i. said give ‘em that 80′s cocaine
somethin’ raw, something pure so i stayed in that vain
the hero that he know, that he cold
like winters below in the geo, wipe ya feet off in the regal
i’m king, observe the throne and the dream
i have it, supreme like mathematics
yeah, i rep the fresh air for you asthmatic rap addicts
pro black magic, this is semi-automatic
rap we won’t jam in traffic
the game need direction, i’m here to map it
uh, some people say that they be missing creativity
but when it come to hip hop, it begins and it’s with me
sweet
you know man, you should know where i come from
you should know who i am nigga
you should never wanna go against me
you know man, you too soft for that man
i be seeing you man, i see it in your eyes man
you aint the type of nigga to go against me
you get in my presence you gon’ feel like a little hoe
you aint a man yet, you tryna be somebody else
man, be yourself man, you come around my crib, you get your shit took
huh, wherever you go, you probably be overseas in europe and get yo shit took
you’s a hoe, you know you sweet
aint nothing you can do man, people see that man
broads be seeing you sweet
done wit’ you muthafuckas, it’s over for you
it’s over for you? it’s over, sweet muthafucka
