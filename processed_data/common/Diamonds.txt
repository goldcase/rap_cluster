"diamonds"
(feat. big sean)
(oh) walk up in the thing, got my campaign poppin’
champagne poppin’, bad thing poppin’
headed to the door, and ain’t a damn thing knockin’ (no)
walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin’
campaign poppin’, champagne poppin’
i wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day
niggas gotta eat, we gon’ do it gourmet
i’m hearing fuckin’ voices, like when porn play
stay, stay on your grind like foreplay
what more can i say? diamonds are for the day
that means to shine, you find a way
stayed on porches, backyards, and gainways
learned strange ways between  and langley
champagne ambitions
i pour it out for my man who made his transition
was about paper, pussy, prada, ego
born to fly, call me the bald eagle
open shows at the regal for daddy kane and eazy-e though
boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
the hero that came from zero
my bars and my pr like puerto rico
this bra from the dr said i was frío
that’s ice cold like dre, triple three yo
pino noir style, better with time
i’m gambling with watches getting better with time
so i’mma ride this out for long as god allow me
they say “time is money”, forever is my salary
i shine tomorrow with what i do today
yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display
(oh) walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin’
champagne poppin’, bad thing poppin’
headed to the door, and ain’t a damn thing knockin’ (no)
walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin’
campaign poppin’, champagne poppin’
hit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppin’ (no)
ay, ay, ay , ay , ay, ay, ay, ay
tryna get it every way, every day
tryna get it every way, every day
tryna get it every way, every day
bars in alignment, stars in alignment
of consignment, god’s in the diamonds
evolve from the science, power and refinement
read between the lines, hard to define us
niggas that’s behind us, throwing up signs to signify us
in the benz leaning like we biased
i seen lead fly by us, that shit scary
you can go cold and blow everything you have in a flash
the moment is to live it like your last
moments that we have never living in the last
my time, man, precious like diamonds
look through the glass, see what i magnify man
i’mma be shining ‘til i die man
i’mma rare diamond that’s hard to find man
climbing to the mountain top, mlk day
to the streets i speak my piece like an a.k
47 to 87 to the hundreds
jewels i could run it for the hunted and the blunted
dreams reflect clarity, ain’t no disparity
between peace and prosperity, so marry me diamond
reminiscing when i had everything on layaway
i’m rolling with me and my partner like it was training day
way before the ballin’ that was back off in the training days
i used to hit the barber chair and say “i need that fadeaway”
had a crush on what’s her name, the feelings never fade away
older brother gang bang, banging like an 808
said you can’t take his chain away
real play you can’t take his game away
slang away, walk up in this thing like a real rockefeller
but you can’t take my dame away, devil in a red dress
but she got that angel face
i could teach her how to get it day to day to day to day
the g code is my combination
catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
catch me in court, beating all kinds of cases
weed, money, pussy, liquor, that’s my favorite combination
diamonds
