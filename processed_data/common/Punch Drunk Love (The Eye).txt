like now i'm off the wine (wine)
and we can take our time (time)
so much i want to i wants to fronts spilled the bump when we grind
my uh in is ya body
my uh is in ya mind
check my dictionary
that ass is so divine
it slippery when its wet girl
i can read the signs
i knocked and i knocked (uh) can i come inside
i knocked and i knocked girl can i come inside
i feel like its home when i'm in between ya thighs
it's the joy, and the pain, and the bites and the brain
what make it feel so good
that type of stuff u cant explain
i do what i do to do to make it rain
u got the invite tonight
and i'm so glad ya came
cuz you the type that danger we gain in yo
mic check like the way i begin my show
girl i come from chi-ca-so n i go
turn around its about to be a tko
some call me com (com)
some call me the red (red)
u can call me daddy, i'ma put ya to bed
an appetite for seduction
and it gotta be fed
her sexual eruption got ya hitting ya head
on the board
and knock and screaming, oh lord
we exchange like students cuz i student abroad
and listen to ya body and low key partin'
and i keep pushing and pushing
u bout to volley em' up
we the type to make lovin and we up
we take a ride down south cuz u need to re-up
girl u call me big bank like i was saving it up
i'm the doctor i can hold it till my patients is up
i make, i make i make it hot baby
i know i know i know just stop baby
when we do it like we don't want it to end
its 3 pm we gon do it again.
come on girl lets go
to distant lands unknown
we can fly on air
if love is everywhere,
for you and me
