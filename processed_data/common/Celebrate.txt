"celebrate"
everybody home, ain’t nobody gone
and i got all my niggas around
it feel good, don’t it? getting hood on it
and i got all my niggas around
i got a couple minutes in town
a couple hundred bitches around
so baby gonna get us a round
cause i got all my niggas around
celebrate
we partying, yeah got body in
exotic broads lobbying, spanish, somalian
fly, we live it ’til we die
we living in the night, toast looking in her eye
on our paper ’til we get it like dubai
chi niggas stand up, plastic cups
girls with the drastic butts, that ask for bucks
it don’t stop here
bottles of veuve pop here
and we gonna get around like 2pac’s here
celebrate like it’s new year
some bomb rocks coming, type nuclear
yeah, it’s so ridiculo’
lit the medicinal, passed it give-and-go
backwards liquor store
celebrate
everybody home, ain’t nobody gone
and i got all my niggas around
it feel good, don’t it? getting hood on it
and i got all my niggas around
i got a couple minutes in town
a couple hundred bitches around
so baby gonna get us a round
cause i got all my niggas around
celebrate
in my paul smith like an alcoholic
my guys i used to hoop with, is now who i ball with
this raw bitch came in looking flawless
tonight she’ll be giving conscious, headlights!
beaming from the beemer that her momma bought her
i got to act right for her like i’m an author
look where drama brought us, look where karma brought us
married to the game, like usher we was caught up
now we got some r&b broads we can call up
you niggas come around keep the wall up
smoke blowing out thinking of tomorrow and the simple things
hustlas from the go, how far we done came
celebrate
everybody home, ain’t nobody gone
and i got all my niggas around
it feel good, don’t it? getting hood on it
and i got all my niggas around
i got a couple minutes in town
a couple hundred bitches around
so baby gonna get us a round
cause i got all my niggas around
celebrate
ah, another night, we love the night
for the life, getting bugged tonight
wait ’til i get my money right
told you it’s gonna be on like the benz’s that we lean on
put my team on, get our heat on
ah, i knew her when she strip, her name was chardonnay
my niggas move work even on a holiday
we come from porches and alleyways
i’m the big ticket, don’t need no one to validate
you celebrate
we ain’t gotta wait
it’s a toast to you and me
bills ain’t so bad, celebrate that
party in the yard ’til the lights come on
ain’t nobody crying
we’ve come so far, been climbing
know the clouds they passed us by
c’mon and raise your glass up high
everybody home, ain’t nobody gone
and i got all my niggas around
it feel good, don’t it? getting hood on it
and i got all my niggas around
i got a couple minutes in town
a couple hundred bitches around
so baby gonna get us a round
cause i got all my niggas around
celebrate
