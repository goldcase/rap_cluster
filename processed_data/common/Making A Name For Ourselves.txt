common lyrics
"making a name for ourselves"
(feat. canibus)
yeah, yeah
me and my man com sense
rallyin troops like joseph stalin
where you at yo?
i'm bout to make the name com sense a name you fear
y'all niggaz is scared, i'm your worst nightmare squared
and i'ma make the name canibus a name you fear
y'all niggaz is scared, i'm your worst nightmare squared
that's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware
(rakim from "my melody"(to catch another sucka duck mc out there)
i can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
i hold mics while you hold spite
like a broken hearted bitch
don't give no fuck who yo team or who you startin with
cameoed or charted with, i house niggaz like apartments with
mic mechanisms, i dissect a rhythm
move crowds with kinetic wisdom
it's like a malcolm x-orcisim, fuck the rhythm, i hit him
i want him got not get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him
i'm creatin the ultimate verses with perfect lines
puttin together them whether my rhyme one threat at a time
so you niggaz need to stop testin me
cuz you know you can't "f" with me
steppin to me with insuperior weaponry
exposin yourself to the verbal radiations
sayin you can defeat me is nothin but speculation
lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
niggaz be diggin my styles like fossils and pterodactyls
who wanna battle?
i'm bad to the bone marrow
the earth got one sun but i walk with three shadows
with allah, my supernatural bodyguard
niggaz couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
mcs will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
i'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch
what!
common, steppin to me is like going to the county being a neutron
common, i ain't scared of no nigga
i persue sound fairs, relaxed like dru down's hair
other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, i throw down theirs
on knots, i landed, players get played like hamlet
supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
i write twice and drop singles in record pools
niggaz i'm dunkin like when cops mingle
fuck hip hop jingles, rhymin big words and not sayin shit
the click that you came in with accent your flavor wit
like moose, i go to the caves and get niggaz off all fours
i'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
far more advanced than a rapper who's career
you could only take a glance, couldn't make the transition
>from b-boy to c-note stance
i stand in a circumference, the humbleness
but in the chi, bumbleless
was thinkin as a weakness were poetrys in motion
like a bitch, i'm the main feature
amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
i make my living off of singles like latifah
in between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
you couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
i'm cold with numb intentions
fuck with canibus
yo, the canibus is an animal with a mechanical mandible
comin to damage you, spittin understandable slang at you
i be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead sharp peripheral
with 360 degree visual
when the signal was given, mcs get biten with venom
>from a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
my style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
my face don't belong in the source
it belongs on the shroud of turan, for certain
i grab mics and murder shit
it's wickeder than satan worshippers going to catholic church services
you heard of this
the lyrical verbalist, trash herbalist
the wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
and i swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
i'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as, you gay ass fag
i'll blow you to ashes with tactics
strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
so phat to be a rap star, takin pictures at music seminars
people know who you are
now i got mad shorties that wanna call me
because they saw me, up in the source chillin on page 40
put this in your cd-rom
www dot canibus dot com
you can find me on the internet talkin to chicks
that was sweatin me off the music makes me high remix
i be talkin mad trash tryin to get 'em to laugh
see, if i click and drag long enough, i'll get the ass
bring it bag to the lab on mount prospect ave.
let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
you know how we do, liquid aluminum like the t2
beast from the east part 2, comin to see you
it's time i made the name com sense a name y'all fear
y'all niggaz is scared, i'm your worst nightmare squared
now that i made the name canibus a name you fear
you still scared, i'm your worst nightmare squared
that's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware
(to catch another sucka duck mc out there)
since i made the name com sense a name y'all fear
y'all niggaz is scared, i'm your worst nightmare squared
and since i made the name canibus a name you fear
you stay scared, i'm still your worst nightmare squared
that's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware
(to catch another sucka duck mc out there)
