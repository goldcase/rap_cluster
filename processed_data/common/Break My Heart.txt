it was a dream day
met her on spring break,
look like the type that be like
"no habla engle"
she said you look like you rap
where's your bling'e
and yours clothes is tight
but you dont seem gay
i said naw

she wasnt married
kept her ring on her pinky
she said "you know i dont be datin' rappers"
i said i got my sag card, baby i'm an actor.

see her again at all star weekend
she didnt have tickets
and she ain't into hoopers
she was there to kick it
with her roommate
who was a video vixen
spend so much on outfits
she's about to get evicted
said "i'm married to this rap shit,
looking for a mistress"
you can be by my side
like flavor and deelicious
long as you ain't scared of the kitchen and the dishes
she said "you one of them fishes, i know your mind switches", and..
oo..we you break my heart,
but i'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")
oo..we you break my heart,
but i'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")
oo..we you break my heart,
but i'll be there beside you,
with lots of love to give you (give, give it, uh)
(love to give..you, you) (give, give it, yeah)
love to give you (give, give it, uh)
love to give (give, give it, yeah)
time revolve
we fell in love as crazy as nas and them
broads were textin
cuz i stop calling them
i met the parents
watch the game with her father and
questions of marriage
and i start dodging them
what happen to me
happens to lots of men
get deep in love
and then your needing some oxygen
as far as wives i was thinking like solomon
she said "there you go, breakin my heart again!"
oo..we you break my heart,
but i'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")
oo..we you break my heart,
but i'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")

love to give (give, give it, yeah)
