"start the show"
(feat. kanye west)
now let's start the show show
step out of the cold cold
we come from the 'go, 'go
to the top of the globe globe
the pimps and the hoes hoes
the folks and the stones stones
whoever you ride fo', we back for some mo'
get back to the show show, you know
uhh, uhh
ladies and gentlemen the c-o-double-m-o-n
synonym for fresh, truth is the emb-lem
hardcore since i was next door to clem and them
cold as the winter when fake niggaz was shiverin
shakin in they timberlands, you was played as bennigans
hot for a minute, now you just a "remember him"
i been a +master+ since p was no limit-in
stick a sayin, no gimmick and no mimickin
q infinitin down old blocks are bendin in
yellin (fuck tha police) like ren and them
pelican brief these niggaz on who i be
before the paper and the fame niggaz knew rashid
noble like dru ali - many have come
but few have been chose to be a true mc
you sing along wit it, inside you knowin it's wack
young who? i don't need a openin act
let, let, le-le-le-le-le-let's go
it's a festival in hip-hop; we do it non-stop
pop your bottles, chicago niggaz do it in staccato
choppin notes for my homies, fuck a motto
and farragamo shoes givin dudes the model
think fast, drive slow, survival is the throttle
your live show is hollow, shoulda kept it local
rappin over vocals, soundin soft as jojo
with twelve monkeys on stage it's hard to see who's a gorilla
you was better as a drug dealer
feel the passion of this b-boy ration-al
half of it is what you say, and half is style
guess it's time for you to stop cashin now
it's over folks, tell your guys to put the glasses down
masters now, verses touch the youth like a catholic priest
performances keep me stackin the sheets
"and you say chi-city, let's go chicago!"
"yo, y'all can make more noise than that!"
"get live y'all, get live y'all, ah-get live y'all
ah-get live y'all, ay y'all can get louder than that
louder, louder!"
