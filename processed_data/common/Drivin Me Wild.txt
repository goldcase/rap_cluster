"drivin' me wild"
(feat. lily allen)
it's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
i gotta see what's up before it gets me down
it's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
i gotta see what's up before it gets me down
it's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
i gotta see what's up before it gets me down
no it's not a mystery, it's everything
she was the type to watch oprah and the today show
be on the treadmill, uh, like "okay, go"
had a body, a body that you can't pay fo'
that mean she had some ds on her but they wasn't fake though
had a drive for a drive for rodeo
she spent pesos on those lebeaus
spin class at the gym, strip tease on a pole
she was so obsessed with her body and clothes
to every party she goes, tryin hard to be chose
they say it's hard for a pimp but extra hard for these (hoes)
readin us and people mag, tryna get the scoop
chasin a actor for a bentley coupe
she been through the ball player from the clippers, then came the pumps
all thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
doin all she can for a man and a baby
drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady
it's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
i gotta see what's up before it gets me down
it's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
i gotta see what's up before it gets me down
it's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
i gotta see what's up before it gets me down
no it's not a mystery, it's everything
he had paper since we was in we was in high school
pop was a doc, mom taught at my school
lock with the rocks, in his ears he kept jewels
one of the diddy types, da d-d-dame dash dudes
pushed a maserati sport, readin the robb report
wanted to be mike but he was never live at sports
since golf is in he was on the drivin course
to live the rap life is what he was strivin for
spendin cash at the bar to get credit
drinkin chaundon just because big said it
they say ye is but dude was big headed
rocked the fur in the summer so somebody'd pet it
he had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
pathetic on his myspace page half nekkid
it's a shame what they do for fame and to be respected
joe, you coulda got it if you never woulda stressed it
it's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
i gotta see what's up before it gets me down
it's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
i gotta see what's up before it gets me down
it's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
i gotta see what's up before it gets me down
no it's not a mystery, it's everything
they was one of them couples, people said they were the it
unbreakable, like bobby and whit
or ryan and reese, or kimora and russ
relationships can be dead but look live to us
i guess we all been through it where we try too much
losin yourself and you're lyin and stuff
wishin for the diamond cuffs, in search of a ring
where love is not a mystery it's everything
it's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
i gotta see what's up before it gets me down
it's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
i gotta see what's up before it gets me down
it's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
i gotta see what's up before it gets me down
no it's not a mystery, it's everything
gets me down
gets me down
gets me down
gets me down
gets me down
gets me
no it's not a mystery, it's everything
