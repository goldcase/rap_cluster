"blak majik"
(feat. jhen√© aiko)
blak majik
who that boy he radical
talk that money talk emphatical
who in the game had the baddest hoes
niggas seen badu's ass and said "i seen what you was on"
home grown with no home phone
from the city of wind nigga, win or go home
it's the chi bullshit i'm on
make a dome from a brick and a pocket full of stones
hit them cones, clips and crones
i don't play away games, i got hitters at home
i'm a dime like six in the morn'
me and muhammad speak in similar tones
go hard like pyramid stones
stand the test of time cross the burning sands
with aggressive rhymes, i'm blessed to rhyme
i invest in time
like superman, stick out my chest and shine, i'm
blak majik
yeah yeah, i'm black, i'm magical
i ride fun facts that's actual
keep it one hunnid that's natural
to get them new blue hunnid niggas strapped with flow
shout out to black and dc make it capital
i done made enough. i don't have to rap no more
tell the truth, that ain't what i'm rapping fo'
got a whole lot so we can have some mo'
so rosey go to red diamond make 'em clap some more
clap clap, home of the original gang bangers, gun clappers, no lackers, rack stackers
movie, we are black actors
makin' somethin' out of nothin' blak majik
what i do, i own like magic
status of the livest and established
girl with the fattest, i'm givin' you the gladdest
like you ever had this magic
neewteb ni tsixe i ereh ton ma i
maerd ruoy ni evah uoy suoicsnoc eht ma i
i am the matter that cannot be seen
i am the conscious you have in your dream
do not be scared of my dark energy
i am not here i exist in between
yeah that's me i'm magical
i'm black i'm strapped with magic bro
i'm nothing you have had before
i'm everything but nothing more
