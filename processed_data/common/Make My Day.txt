"make my day"
(feat. cee-lo)
ahh the sun is shining brighter cause you really make my day
you really make my day
ohhh oh oh
yeah i think i like her cause she really makes my day
yeah she really makes my day
ohhh oh oh
(ohhh oh oh) see her on the beach she was wrappped in a towel
her bodys going down see her ass crack to smile
enjoying the nile (woo) take it the breeze
or some cat a mouse
and she was the cheese on the sun keys
yeah on a conversation
california dreamin now california-cation
said she had drinks in the coller and i had an inventation if i wanted i could brewer this is just an invdication on
how cool she was
a couple of chicks came
groupie love
they aint want no pictures
im think damn damn thats really cool because sometimes i wannta chill sometimes the best things in life are not even planned
came to the sand and got more than a tan
baby girl im a man
and we can do this my way
take a ride on the highway and pretend that its friday
ahh the sun is shining brighter cause you really make my day
you really make my day
ohhh oh oh
yeah i think i like her cause she really makes my day
yeah she really makes my day
ohhh oh oh
(ohhh) she was at a bar-b-que
pretty painted nails she took off her shoes
grammer school
sippin on some l thinking man shes cool
sun smiling on her hair
playing spades and we can be a pair
i love it when its sunny girl
you could be my cher
inderpendence day and freedoms in the air
dance and danced away yo
showing steppin like a tango
like me, got me
sweet as icy spicy
drip from my lips
we can do something hip
trip around the world in a day
play phonia a
ahh the sun is shining brighter cause you really make my day
you really make my day
ohhh oh oh
yeah i think i like her cause she really makes my day
yeah she really makes my day
ohhh oh oh
ahh the sun is shining brighter cause you really make my day
you really make my day
ohhh oh oh
yeah i think i like her cause she really makes my day
yeah she really makes my day
ohhh oh oh
