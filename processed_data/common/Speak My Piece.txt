"speak my piece" lyrics
common lyrics
"speak my piece"
i just, speak my piece, keep my peace
cubans with the jesus piece, with my peeps
packing, my piece, jesus
packing, my piece, jesus
i'm iller than most, sick with it, feeling the dose
in a butter soft leather but i'm still with the toast
toast to bros, you know the millions is close
feel the ghost of notorious, tell me who the naughtiest
she get live like an audience
i do what i do, no need to state the obvious
poli' with girls with bodies, uh
poli' in hotel lobbies
light a j, it's just me and marley, look at the poster
do what i supposed to for the culture
early b-boy, down with d-boys, build and destroy
my pride and joy is my daughter named omoy
'ye, that's my nigga from back in the day
all that whoop-de-wah-whoop, man fuck what they say
played the lotto for my gram with a bottle in hand
lay it down for the world, for chicago i stand, and
yeah, yeah, they like that, i write raps from on top of the world
popular girls always wanna pop in my world
i pop out in the boroughs and go to l.a. to get hay
in the middle of the barn with a princess i laid
yo, this type of shit happens every um, once in a while
you know i won't front with the style
bring life to the party like a woman and child
from the land of the humble and proud, summers is wild
ah! made the unmade-able
ah! go to parties i'm paid to go
me and cuzzo talked the hustle
about doing good business like rick and russell
you i know i guzzle red wine till it's bed time
on my paper like headlines, she want the head shine e'ry time
my time, the streets is watching like a rollie
do it for the hometown and the homies, uh
