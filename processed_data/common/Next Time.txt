"next time"
(feat. queen latifah)
i'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close
squeeze you tight, the next time that i see you
i'm gonna tell you i love you, cross my heart
and i hope i die
the next time that i see you
i grew up, talking chi-town slang
never played soccer but loved to kick game
loved chicks with thick frames
and big-lipped dames
might see 'em on my arm
cause i charm like thick chains
i was at the knicks game, they were playing the nets
courtside so i could hear the shit they say to the refs
thugs, this type of stuff you can't express in a text
see the section of girls who be dressing for checks
that's when she stepped in front of me
light-skinned, long hair like a school days wannabe
a big 'ol (whoo) let's just say she was blessed
she had got it from her mama, god gave her the rest
we was being introduced by mutual friends
like kobe in the 4th, that's when the game begins
game begins, games begins
i'm from the windy city, so i play to win c'mon
we conversated tough about life and stuff
told her, tonight was just right for us
she was, flavor most and i can spice it up
be my black victoria beckham once i wife it up
asked when the next time we could speak
i might khloe you, marry you in 3 weeks
seen cheeks, she was like 'she don't remember my name'
that's when i realized ain't no gender in game
i thought, like "man! you don't know me?"
i'm the black guy in the flick with angelina jolie
boldly, she told me 'oh you got moves'
her friends said 'no, really though, he's a good dude'
after couple months of dating and pairs of good shoes
being snapped by the papps, we shared the good news
we were engaged, though many was confused
i'm from the windy city, so i will not lose...come on
she had a dope figure, y'all can go figure
should of listened to 'ye, cause she was a gold digger
i ain't a dumb nigga, she was able to pull it
love happy, blindsided like sandra bullock
or could it be, things go the way that they should
from the, unexpected, love could be understood
and in the real game, only love can win
i got to win, cause i fell in love with her friend
