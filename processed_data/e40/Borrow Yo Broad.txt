"borrow yo' broad"
(feat. b-legit)
beeyatch!
it's a fool cause i'm in texas-arkana right?
i seen baby girl, she say, look ah uh you know what i say to myself
i say, she look like baby dattaway! (dattaway!)
you smell that?  i say look here
i been lookin for you in the broad daylight with a flashlight baby
where you been?  (where you been?)
yeah, like my nigga pimpin' ken
what we really need to do is put that hoe on the track man
(any batch, superbad, any batch, smell that?)
what we really need to do is put that hoe on the track man
(any batch, superbad, any batch, smell that?)
well let me borrow yo' broad (let me borrow yo' broad)
let me borrow yo' batch (let me borrow yo' batch)
let me borrow yo' bootch (let me borrow yo' bootch)
let me borrow that hoe! (let me borrow that hoe!)
i hear fetti (petty) callin (callin)
callin (callin) yeah the bitch subject again
broke and reckless eyeballin, fuckin around with charlie hustle main
it's in my spine (it's in my spine)
and what's deeply and hella obvious that what the broad think
is her business, must be mine
i put the tick in the time, i thought you knew (i thought you knew)
retire (retire) - tsh, beeyatch (beeytach!)
through with it before most of these square dancers
even had any kind of idea what to with it, get tired (get tired)
he ain't gon' bust a girl, that ain't you toughest (that ain't you toughest)
dude i cain't play a fool, potnah i'm a solid nigga dig this (dig that)
suspension (suspension)
bitch got to pay me hoe, or pay me no attention!
what we really need to do is put that hoe on the track man
(any batch, superbad, any batch, smell that?)
what we really need to do is put that hoe on the track man
(any batch, superbad, any batch, smell that?)
well let me borrow yo' broad (let me borrow yo' broad)
let me borrow yo' batch (let me borrow yo' batch)
let me borrow yo' bootch (let me borrow yo' bootch)
let me borrow that hoe! (let me borrow that hoe!)
pay attention, this one with extension, big boots with the gloves
seems she's lookin for love
spent a dub at the bar with her, see i promised not to hit her
long as i can get her
to the floor fashion show, short skirt and high heels
so the ass can show, satisfaction
action make her ask for mo', gettin dough
don't need no hoe that's po', you know?
you'd rather blow fo' with the snowbunny, well i ain't mad
cause the hoe money mo' money, sweet as snow money
bring it to a pimp so he maintain wealth
forty g's on the yacht, i got cock for sale
might bail to miami, nine hoes deep
red bull and my bad hoes get no sleep
gators on my feet, i talk shit you know
on how everything here is a hoe
what we really need to do is put that hoe on the track man
(any batch, superbad, any batch, smell that?)
what we really need to do is put that hoe on the track man
(any batch, superbad, any batch, smell that?)
well let me borrow yo' broad (let me borrow yo' broad)
let me borrow yo' batch (let me borrow yo' batch)
let me borrow yo' bootch (let me borrow yo' bootch)
let me borrow that hoe! (let me borrow that hoe!)
beeyatch!
smell, smell, char-lie
smell, smell, smell me
smell, smell, the cheezie
smell, smell, smell away
you can't make a tramp a champ even if you put her on a stamp
that bitch still wouldn't be worth a cryin dime
a blue nickel, or a screamin quarter
40-water put it in order
bitch it's about cb&h and i ain't talkin about pure cane sugar
i'm talkin about cock a butt and head
cock, butt, and head
cock, butt, and head
cock, butt, and head
cock, butt, and head
beeyatch!
what you need to do is put that hoe on the track baby
right now, or let me borrow that broad
let me borrow that batch
let me borrow that bootch
let me borrow that hoe
