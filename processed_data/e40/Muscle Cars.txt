"muscle cars"
(feat. keak da sneak, turf talk)
muscle cars - yeeeey!
not out of the local news paper, but out the autotrader
cleaner, than virgin cuchie, my nigga, one on her cutlass, player
the beat wrapped in monster cables, the speaker's thumping
trunk sounding like godzilla, and king kong, back there thumping
all we do is wic, and get high and pedal and push!
organic weed, mystery weed, just purple cush!
i cut the rear weld, on my whip, and filled that bitch up
and now muscle car sitting up high like a monster truck
monster up, suck up to none, don't be no poodle
split his pack open like pack of top ramen noodle
in the heart of the soil, where you can find me
try me fuck boy and get your face put on a white tee
40, turf talk and keak the sneak
they maynee ass voices, and they styles is hekka unique
high speed chase's and running lights
water in the duals, make loud glass pipes
four barrel carburetor, four speed trany
dual exhaust dipped in sauce
my car is a beast, catch me in the streets side ways
threw the east side-boy, crunk like lil' jon
show 40, and mac keak the last don
east oakland the land of the side show
richmond, frisco, to the valley jo
i'm riding side ways, this way and that way
door's open, while in traffic
hold the door open (hello!)
shitting on 'em, no fronting
455 got me running up on aston martins
we run from them on streets, not the freeway
b&m shift kit (kirrrk) me and danny phea
on my celly cell straight lace with no fucking dew
mobbing in my ol' school, like lil' bruce
four 15's, beat supreme
told niggas fuck rally's, ride gold one's mayne
mother's off candid, don't hate 'cause i ain't me
race, foo, smoke in your face, foo
super charger, push this button and my engine start up
pistol tucked
might be pirmiered, but my engine souped up
quick to the floor when you open yours
don't scratch my doors. 350 i push heavy
not a ford it's (chevy, chevy, chevy)
first owner, not too many miles on her
we rep the bay, we don't rep california (i'm liyng)
i'm run you for your car note
why you don't got ss's in front of your monte carlo?
residence full of white folks
i'm leave fresh tire marks top of they asphalt
you got muscle car? you fucking with them muscle cars?
