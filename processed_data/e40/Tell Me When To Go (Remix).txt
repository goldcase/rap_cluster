this {?} colored slushie got me feelin like da man of steel
energy hyphy drink (drink); spinner steerin wheel
mardi gras beads around my neck (neck), invisible set
pull-outs (pull-outs!) diamonds on my mouth (bling)
rally stripes, hustle cars, vans and campers (campers)
my dude got handle bars, get out yer cameras (get out yer cameras)
wet the tar down, break out the crates (oooh...)
we on the swerve ice skatin, doin figure eights (errrh!!!)
the king of slang, they call me ebonics ('bonics!)
