"extra manish"
(feat. young mugzy)
i'm a little mannish muthafucka
i take after my older brother
started off selling marijuana but now i'm selling yola
shit was gettin hella funky at first
when a nigga was stealin a bitches purse
ended up gettin kicked out of every vallejo school
they clocked me like a circus
i was the little mannish motherfucker showing off in the back of the church
my momma was quick to hit me with a switch and i say "that hurts"
get to the house, go to my room and talk some trash
i never believed a hard head made a soft ass
cuz i be moving fast and i'd be tryin to stash
beat up the pizza man and then i straight dashed
disobidient sport cut my days short
my momma got tired of takin' my ass back and forth ta court
i said "momma i'ma straighten up for you and i promise i won't warrant"
got me a job as a paper boy
21 dollars a month
5 o'clock in the morning
damn i'm slavin' for the fucking white man
21 dollars might buy me some ??(poor carpet chicken george)
i'm tired of muthafuckas fuckin over me
how can i find a way to make some real money?
but you don't feel me
i was tired of being broke lookin coked down
came up off a twenty dollar put me down
next thing you know i was up to about a quarter of a ki' rollin
niggaz was trippin' off me cuz i was a young muthafucka ballin'
gettin my fetti on but when there was funk i had to starve
time to fetch the choppers and bring out the u-hauls
extra mannish
i make you vanish
i play for keep
investigate that ass till they find out where you sleep
muthafucka it's commakausi
don't even try me ahh
i bars none you best believe that i'ma bring me ah
fully automatic tommy with the infared say i'm sorry
before i pump your ass full of lead and dump the body
extra mannish, that's what people be calling me
oh we can be cool until you get to threatening me
i loose my temper and shit my eyes turn red
blow my top and get real hot at the head
i guess i'm a failure, i gots no future in my front
all i'm able to do is sell dope and hit the blunt
don't ask me why sometimes i go to church and testify
the preacher preaches and i be dang near ready to cry
repute the devil
i got to get out of the ghetto freak
sometimes i wonder if mommy and daddy really payin me
who would ever thought that a nigga like me
would become such a bad ass youngster
my mommy and daddy done fucked around and created a damn monster
why couldn't i wait till i was bigger
before i started drinking malt liquor
i guess i was a nappy headed stubborn little mannish ass nigga
guess who comes through, comes through
it's me the y-o-u-n-g
m-u-g-z
i'm just as mannish as i wanna be i pack a 30-30
niggas wanna blast me because i'm down and dirty
extra mannish how i'm livin and i'm fuckin my neighbors bitch an
she lovin' every minute of the dick that i be givin
bitches on my jock , bitches on my jock
suckas on the block know i got a glock
bini caps, b-coats and all of that
i'm beatin niggas down with a baseball bat
i'm havin revenues i'm gettin paid fool
a ghetto muthafucka with an attitude
s-i-c-k   w-i-d   i-t
it's young mugzy and e-40
it's  explains why it's hard for us blacks and hispanics
and why we turned extra mannish
