"everyday is a weekend"
(feat. the jacka of mob figaz)
i like dis! (e-40, check) i like dis
uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh (yeah, uhh)
uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh - beitch!
let me get at 'em (yeah)
look (let's live it up) get at 'em peyimp
uhh, flea flickin, money i don't like to miss
i'm tryin to give my rubberbands a facelift (a facelift?)
i've been doin it for a while (for a while)
like it's goin out of style
party foul, mixin drinks to spoil it
i was blankin so hard, dropped my iphone in the toilet
the other day ago (where was you at?) at the club (uh-huh)
in the bathroom stall, smokin some bud
saw some suckaz i don't trust (what they do?)
got to bringin up old lummydumps (lummydumps)
pullin up the past (up the past)
talkin loud like a bigmouth bass (fuck you nigga, fuck you!)
i told 'em not to shout
we can settle this like gentlemen or i'm a air this bitch out
... like a poot
killers move in silence (like what?) like mute
no matter what, we kingpins
look at the stars and the, cars we came in (yeah)
i gives a fuck we got bent
livin it up, everyday's a weekend
uhhh! i'm havin my bread
although i'm not the sharpest tool in the shed (in the shed)
foot patrol in my neck of the woods  - what else?
officers on foot in heavy crime neighborhoods
turnin night into day (night vision)
helicopters, tryin to catch they prey
uhh, send a decoy or a dummy (or a dummy)
set up artistses and marked money (marked money)
uhh, tryin to give us hella summers
tryin to give us hella time, tryin to give us football numbers
tryin to take it to other heights (other heights)
where the heck is my lawyer? read me my rights! (read me my rights)
they say his bail 300 stacks (what's that?)
10% of that is 30 racks (30 racks) wow!
soil ballatics
what a real nigga cain't do - cain't crack, won't snitch
that's right!
