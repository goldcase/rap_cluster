"hood boy"
i bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range
iced out vvs stones and a chain
she want a hood boy
i bet you ain't never seen a nigga pushin' that work
gettin it, how he live stuntin' on the turf
she want a hood boy
she want a hood boy
she don't want no mark
body art on his arm's and neck and across his heart
they throwin' up the block
i represent my part
it's a zoo i got more animals then noah's ark
i keep the bottles cracked
i got the dro sparked
44 cocked
s65 parked
i'm a hood boy
i be ridin' wet
insides jelly
touchscreen deck
they say you go boy
i love yo' swag and 'staljha'
i remember fo' you rap you used to sell that yowder
breitling for bentley watch
26 inch socks
pick a ride girl
i got a car lot
i bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range
iced out vvs stones and a chain
she want a hood boy
i bet you ain't never seen a nigga pushin' that work
gettin it, how he live stuntin' on the turf
she want a hood boy
i got paper
but i be on the under
every 3 or 4 weeks i change my phone number
pope's be trying to watch me
on some old shit
i give em' the same line
i don't know shit
i don't want a model
i want some stretch marks
30 pound butt meat cheeks pull apart
damn i be coonin'
japanese jeans on
shorty on my line
she got me on her ringtone
she love me
i like her
i'm too hood
to wife her
i'm to hood to wife her
plus i got 3 just like her
i'm on this xo landy
mixed with 40 water
i bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range
iced out vvs stones and a chain
she want a hood boy
i bet you ain't never seen a nigga pushin' that work
gettin it, how he live stuntin' on the turf
she want a hood boy
i can tell when she lookin' at me
i can tell she wan't a nigga from the streets
she wan't that hood boy
i can tell when she lookin' at me
i can tell she wan't a nigga like 40
she wan't that hood boy
i bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range
iced out vvs stones and a chain
she want a hood boy
i bet you ain't never seen a nigga pushin' that work
gettin it, how he live stuntin' on the turf
she want a hood boy
