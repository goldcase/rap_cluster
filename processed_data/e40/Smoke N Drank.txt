"smoke 'n drank"
(spit that shit)
durrin a playa like ma dukes
i think i recall when i got my first tooth
i was a teeny little ol teether perv on flea little bitches
some like a little further on down the line
started fuckin with moonshine, all kind of wines
stood in front of the liquor house so i can get mine, from old timers
buy me a drank man i know it's against the law my name's liquor sport
what you need my little catarada a packet of kool-aid and some throw up
what else?  a thing of b's and a short naked night train
whatchu gonna give me?  a crumpled up foodstamp that i won in a dice game
preciate it playa, i'm up out of this bitch bout to go hook up
with my side hill now them shits relatives simple ones kinfolks
good folks, y'know, y'know
twisted, slogan, me and my fools be out there back pervin
to' back on your face and started to roll over
let's perv, throw up, and drank again
let's get high, loaded, and smoke again
just wakin up from my hang-over
still high, like i swallowed an ounce of
hell yeah i don't wanna ever be sober
like bein toishin, wake up in the same position, open up the safe
peep the stash, lookin mighty healthy, plenty of cash
grabbed my partner from up out the charger
and then made a dash called up the folks today is the day
for my nigga's birthday twelve o'clock come through gon get beat
by who?  by them hog mark niggaz in the cleats
we's deep, no remorse no feelings retardos no sorrow
drink it til your motherfuckin insides turn holes to cross and wallow
back to back, struck and strikin, that's your job (that's your job nigga)
to make you lift this tick, fuckit nigga blow a bottle
room spinnin, dead
got the garbage can next to the bed
now i was tweakin off that old crazy ass commercial on bet jackie stallone
what made it so bad is i don't even know how i got home
niggaz ain't feel me y'know fuck this sargeant general
when they peoples be lookin like that indo
dicked a, barren, purple, fish sto'
smob with me i'm tryin to told ya like you get to perkin
ride to me i'll teach you some of this game that i be twerkin
pull this motherfucker over main, you probably gotta go piss again
don't even sweat it though just be on the lookout for so-and-so
now whatchu be callin them po-po's?  tedelknows
penelopes, grill up out of this bitch man
