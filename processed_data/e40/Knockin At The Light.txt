"knockin' at the light"
i heard the story from another nigga
this nigga said you got a problem with some niggas that ain't even from over here
over some dumb shit
seen them same niggas later, they got to knockin at the light
got to knockin at the light, them niggas got to knocking at the light
knockin at the light, them niggas got to knockin at the light, them niggas got to knockin at the light
they don't rat
but he fuck withs 40s and 50s
they block the riches in they city they heavy about their feddy
they on
got a code operation niggas be hating on the players bitches love when they hella popular and know
slide out of some raris, caddies benzes and maseratis, they active they got bodies they ain't playing
games with you suckers, against they mans pull up in the bucket they get to spraying
open up a can, or get him up out the way send him on his way
slid up on the spot with the sk
mom and them still cryin to this very day
cleaning they guns and smoking sherbert
plotting out they plot block
partners is dead they cousin at the light they pop
they having they bread they banked up like the enemy
the nigga thats deads, guns inside the tenessee
they rode in on the greyhound they hella hurting what have you ready to work go to battle ready to beef like the cattle, ready o murk
knock something down do dirt
do they homework
spin a bitch nigga around
pop him in his shirt
surgical gloves and ski mask
veterans, not green like the grass
no gun is where they from, been playing with drugs
gotta an aunty that know where the shooters baby momma stay
over there by safeway and them section 8 houses thats where she stay
anybody can be foumnd, use your brain
shit, look how they found hussein
a ho, in a middle east gotta be creased
thats all it takes to get deceased
never who know who man its a small planet
when theres funk what you do? handle it
when you don't? don't panic
don't be no punk, damage
lights off over lack of discussion
consequences and reprecussions
its almost sight
got on and started knockin at the light!
