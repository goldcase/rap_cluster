"wasted"
(feat. cousin fik)
party goin up, like a airplane
i gotta cup full of octane
yeah i'm on one, more like 2
i don't know about you, but i'm wasted
oh oh oh oh oh oh i'm wasted
one one one one one
one shot two shot three shot
dj let that beat drop cuz i'm wasted
i'm so wasted
ughhhh
i'm goin up like the price of goad
i'm on the phone with the homie
with ya bitch on hold
deep pockets, my paper can't fold
look bankroll so swoll think like a dictionary book
in my demographics we push elbows and bricks
we like to hear ourselves talk, and say slick shit
like i had this one broad named one young ho
her best friends name was nopay
i changed her name to get my dough
operation stack a dollar, i'm having my multiplication
i get faded every day, every days a special occasion
every nights a celebration, used to like a preso
double fist to gettin green like gettin pesto
party goin up, like a airplane
i gotta cup full of octane
yeah i'm on one, more like 2
i dont know about you, but i'm wasted
oh oh oh oh oh oh i'm wasted
one one one one one
one shot two shot three shot
dj let that beat drop cuz i'm wasted
i'm so wasted
look.... i'm out my body wasted
octane in my cup, can't taste it
so it don't make a difference if i chase it
as long as when i finish somebody replace it
fo gotta nigga movin slow like the matrix
dro gotta nigga on like somebody laced it
gucci louis fendi prada all my bitches basic
beat the pussy up yeah my dick catch cases
like young frank ho my dick ain't racist
h got me feeling like i'm in two different places
we blowin out the pound
them haters goin down
but the... but the
party goin up, like a airplane
i gotta cup full of octane
yeah i'm on one, more like 2
i don't know about you, but i'm wasted
oh oh oh oh oh oh i'm wasted
one one one one one
one shot two shot three shot
dj let that beat drop cuz i'm wasted
i'm so wasted
listen to this here
i'm married to my street sign, jump the broom
don't plan on gettin no divorce, no time soon
the black daniel boone, alcohol consume
been drinkin since 1 o clock, this afternoon
cool with all the goons
i'm a tycoon air this bitch out like a helium balloon
ready for war state of mind always on the case
black arsenal like travis air force base
deep like yo bitches throat
yapered up money long like train smoke
she cali pigeon, body crazy
the definition of cali pigeon is shapeless, buttocks
kerne had to get a second taste
how she stack?
stack like some buttermilk pancakes
i'm loaded and i'm twisted and i'm faded
in the function gettin white boy wasted
party goin up, like a airplane
gotta cup full of octane
yeah i'm on one, more like 2
i don't know about you, but i'm wasted
oh oh oh oh oh oh i'm wasted
one one one one one
one shot two shot three shot
dj let that beat drop cuz i'm wasted
i'm so wasted
