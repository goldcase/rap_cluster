"drugs"
(feat. b-legit)
this thang all the way on my got this thang beaten the trunk cruise
i'm on a big ass bottle of beast on some motion spray cranberry juice
and i strongly suggest that you don't sit in my transportation
cause the slot is so severe, and the beast excruciation
my amps my pot me mirror possibly collapse yo lung
what color is your exterior? the same as grey poupon
what is you a baller? yeah but not lebron
then what kind of baller are you? the kind that sell heroin
the kind that lives his life illegal, toted gun and desert eagle
mobster like bugsy siegel i listen to 40 music
don't fuck with too many people mane most of them rappers fake
see feezy be speaking on some shit that i can relate
when i was in the shoe they see desus what got me through
my nigga from the brass to put me up on due, uhh
the grit don't quitting my hustle'll never pause
uh oh! here come the law i got dope in my draws
beatch!
we be grinding seven days a week, heat under the front seat
been to hella corners in my new school, one deep
every hood i'm in i get love from the plug
and a price on your family member drugs (drugs)
how much money can a man make?
i'm on the block cooking chickens with the pancakes
and my fan base love to get high with me
get tipsy prolly set they own self with nicki
get em bicky
beaver he be militant
send the whole fifty clip through ya ligaments
got a knot pocket full of them benjamin's
lil bricks like i'm try'na build a pyramid
shit
40 glock with the laser dot
and i can make mash potatoes outta tater tots
ask ya parking; i don't really like to talk alot
block move like james, wade and chris bosh
let's get it i'm the real boss with the plug
i don't play i'm the nigga man i run the club
keep it rough i'm the mayor doing hella stuff
pass cluff and they smell it when i light it up
nigga what?
we be grinding seven days a week, heat under the front seat
been to hella corners in my new school, one deep
every hood i'm in i get love from the plug
and a price on your family member drugs (drugs)
what you do for a living a little bit of this a little bit of that
if i ain't got it i know where to get it or i can take it to where it's at
i can probably get'chu a deal, get'cha thirty percent off the sack
depending on how many you want, and how much you know that a hustler got
fuckin' right now y'all beefing, then circling yo block
came to the right place, i got chops fresh out the box
can have a foosy grape, if you want me too i can
but i gotta be honest with'chu it's goin cost you twenty grand
and a build with the gumble bout two, i was thought with the best laroo
see laroo been a neighborhood iron chef since 1982
laroo stay clockin' loo, boys in blue ain't gotta clue
laroo ain't never pop comp with a spoon or residue
well what about some weed you got it i beg your pardon
i gotta hella connections my negro my people they got garden
need a fake id or benefit card times is hard
you know christmas is coming up, i got them gift cards
we be grinding seven days a week, heat under the front seat
been to hella corners in my new school, one deep
every hood i'm in i get love from the plug
and a price on your family member drugs (drugs)
