"the ambassador"
sixty eight inches above sea level... ninty three millions miles above these devils...
play me in the winter... play me in the summer... play me in the autumn... any order
play me in the winer... play me in the summer... play me in the autumn... any order
oohh... we gotta anotha one pimp (we got anotha one)
oohh... rock wake'em up boy (wake'em up boy)
sick with it records e-40 (e-40)
oohh
i'm tryna get ma beak wet... i'm a let u shoot da dice and i'm a side bet...
still hungry just ate... madallion same size as a dinner plate... i can't stop...
play me fast fuck around and get mollywhopped...
just got my cob out da shop... wat color u paint it pimp... (apricot)...
you never stop me in da function with a pink coat... wippin da sweat off ma face with a c-note...
they call me uncle 40 water... the ambassador... the top tomata... and to all u sucka's tryina hate... 40 water doin great
i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador,
i'm the ambassoador, i'm the ambassador, i'm ambassador... of da yay (of da yay)
i'm the ambassador.i'm the anbassador, i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador,
i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador... of da yay (of da yay)
play me in da winter... play me in da summer... i'm a old schooler and a new comer...
40 got spit'ems ya'll he be gasin... after all these years he still smilin...
dats wat people be sayin... it's somethin about him he got sum die hard fans... (dedicated)...
real walkie... people really care about him... local boy made good... ex d-boy...
made it out the hood... got his gouda up to par... use to cook yolla in a relish jar...
if a sucka trip and try to suck us out the water... don't just sit there and let him murder mouth yo partna...
teach his ass a lesson... toot him up and give him the thirty second blessin...
i live in da bay with da sting rays and sharks... delta eighty eight bounty feilds and sky marks...
you can't be no mark... marshmellows get pumped if they ain't got no heart... thumper happy...
out here they like to clap... don't get mad and come back... get down where they mad at...
we'll finish it if u start it... air da club out like a muthafucka farted...
money maniac... scorpio... dats ma zodiac... ain't nuthin knew under da sun...
i reach in my pocket and give my one's to da bums... wen the homie go down...
we bail his ass out... we pass the hat around... i remember wen they thought the west was a gonna...
i gave'em cpr and brought us out a comma...
i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador.i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador,
i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador... of da yay (of da yay)
i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador,
i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador, i'm the ambassador... of da yay (of da yay)...
