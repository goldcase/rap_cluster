e-40 lyrics
"be you"
(feat. too short & j banks)
they was wrong when they said ain't nothin new under the sun,
cause everything under the sun has not been done,
what they shouldn't miss? don't miss your call,
the biggest chance you can take is not taking the chance at all,
like who you wanna like, love who you wanna love,
kiss who you wanna kiss, hug who you wanna hug,
latin, white, black, fat, tall, small,
opposites attract whatever it's on y'all,
i came in the game with a hope and a wish,
with no bait on my hook tryna catch a fish,
tryna have meals, 4 courses,
got hella ideas but no resourses,
don't let em knock your motivation keep tryin',
your probably just ahead of your time,
like me, they told me i'd never progress and be-come,
what i am today them niggas dead wrong
you gotta be original, just be you, just be you
take a chance and show the world you, just be you
we gonna hop in the ride and let the rims roll,
gotta hundred pair of nikes no timbos,
and no i never had no afro,
but i still keep everything natural,
so many people wanna look alike,
and act the same, but what's the price,
when you got no game, they won't let you play,
your too stingy, you shouldn't act that way,
cause your goin have to pay, if you don't speak your mind,
you been a follower a long time,
stop lying and just be yourself,
ain't nothin wrong with that,
you got racks, you must be on some crack,
cause the last time i checked you was struggling,
had a whole lotta bad luck drug dealing,
now get back on track like you need to,
stop following the crew and be you, nigga!
do what they don't
when it come to follow trends, you won't,
you got your own mind and your own ideas,
refuse to be like everybody else, (for realz)
so original, (like who?), like me
creative and unique, people love the way i speak
they hatin on the son of the man up above
anything different they afraid of
we comin' through hard again
we got chains and pieces, new car and rims
it's e-40, short dogg and them
alota hustlers, gangstas, all the pimps
it sounds good when you turn it up loud
do it your way and rock your style
your hair your clothes even your smile
they goin love you cause your so original
stop being somebody else when you can be you mane,
be you
you mane
be you
when you can be you mane, be you
stop being somebody else when you can be you mane,
be you,
you mane,
be you,
when you can be you mane,
biatch!
