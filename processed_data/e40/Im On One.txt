"i'm on one"
(you’re on/ you’re on/ you’re on/ you’re on)
i’m on: one, one, one, one, one
i’m on like a pot/ i cook up
i got the hook up
a slap makes the demons look up
i got em’ shook up
...
yayo college is what i took up
northern cali fo ya my nizzle
put up or shut up
homeboy loaded like a shot gun
smokin’ like a chimney
higher
than the trees in yosemite
twisted like a pretzel
drinkin cranberry and cognac
stay afloat keep my head above sea level
so much hate in my region
so much stress in my brain
hey a rapper ain’t eatin’
so he needs someone to blame
so they blame it on ya boy
cause i got the biggest mouth
light it up and have a chain
see the soul train
step your bar game up
practice your penmanship
stop the claiming and making excuses
nigga make a hit
just the other day i heard a fuck nigga say
funny y’all with him but vallejo ain’t in the bay
i said that’s some hard shit a nigga like you would say
cause’ it’s haters like your washed up ass that’s in the way
ugh. tycoon diamonds
glimmin like the sun
i’m in a fucked up mood
and a nigga on one
smokin’ on smelly
yappin on my celly
hustlin’
getting’ money is a habit
always getting dusty
always in the traffic
out of town out of state
doing shows makin’ cake
spitin
