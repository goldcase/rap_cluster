"wake it up"
(feat. akon)
akon! and e-40...yeah....
i know you aint used to havin real niggas around like me around
i'm here to change to your whole life girl, so you don't deal with clowns
and treat you like a superstar that you are
casue i'm a superstar too and i know exactly what i must do to make you...
feel! i'm about to wake it up!
feel! see i'm about to wake it up!
feel! i'm about to wake it up!
don't it feel so good girl
feel! i'm about to wake it up!
feel! see i'm about to wake it up!
feel! i'm about to wake it up!
don't it feel so good girl
i keep it 100's, don't carry nothing but 100's
i'm trying to wake it up, i'm on your line like vonage
i'm a real one, ma!
get rid of that clown, get with a factor
patna don't count, he a lame he don't matter
shining like a big dipper, glowing like a star
lookin up a paw, pullin up in my car
walked right up to the front where the bosses park at
i got a cold mouth piece can talk a chick out her check
security loves me, let me in with no sweat
i see asian persuasion, caucasian, all kinds of chicks
milk skin, chocolate boned, lambs and haitians
tryna take me something home and have some relation
i know you aint used to havin real niggas around like me around
i'm here to change to your whole life girl, so you don't deal with clowns
and treat you like a superstar that you are
casue i'm a superstar too and i know exactly what i must do to make you...
feel! i'm about to wake it up!
feel! see i'm about to wake it up!
feel! i'm about to wake it up!
don't it feel so good girl
feel! i'm about to wake it up!
feel! see i'm about to wake it up!
feel! i'm about to wake it up!
don't it feel so good girl
good god almighty! look at that body

you ain't off the back porch, you're off the hanger!

whole crew fine but you're one of a kind

back that thang up, baby press rewind
imma scorpio, shawty whats your sign?
i'm just tryna know you, hold a conversation
spoil you a lil', lightweight cupcakin'
spend a lil gouda, get your hair done up
imma show you how a tycoon wake that thang up
i know you aint used to havin real niggas around like me around
i'm here to change to change your whole life girl, so you don't deal with clowns
and treat you like a superstar that you are
casue i'm a superstar too and i know exactly what i must do to make you...
feel! i'm about to wake it up!
