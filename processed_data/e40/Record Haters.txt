8-ball, an mjg gettin that independent paper
all about my ruh-uh-rap, uh-should i shine
beat a muthafucka uh-duh-down, e'ry time

take a limosuine everywhere you go and fly private planes
that's what i was taught to do
by my big homie thou
you can always be a nigga,
but a nigga ain't rich til he can't count his money no mo'
over night sensation, never me
all you "record haters" got ph.iv
my niggas  krazy laced me
taught me how to say "fa sheezy"
told me that them az muthafuckas don't believe phat means greasy
we can shoot it out, or we can fight
