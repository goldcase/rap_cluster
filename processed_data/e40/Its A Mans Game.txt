e-40 lyrics
"it's a man's game"
ooooh (ooooh) pencil me in (pencil me in)
it's fonzarelli the ballatician in yo' face again
back again, happenin, with my folks and next of kin
asians blacks and mexicans, caucausian folks and all my friends
lost on gin, count to ten, fits to turtle, hold it in
northern cali, scrilla gone valley, california fools'll do ya
like this song?  sing along, 40 water man you know he wrong
in the traffic mayn on the phone, bright candy on all that chrome
shoes and socks, jacob watch, cd changer with the knock
cock glock back stack leave yo' head off in yo' lap
mark mark sip sap, you ain't gotta like the way
this pimp spit this rap, i don't like you anyway
this a man's game, stay up out the lane
if you can't hang with the gangbang
players pimps and hustlers from the sewer pipes and gutter drains
players pushin mary jane, gorillas in the mix of thangs
boss unleashin off the chain
i was in my chevy blunted doin about a hundred (hundred)
dippin through my hood but the hood lookin haunted (haunted)
task musta raided (raided) i hope my homies made it (made it)
i hope they got some yo-yo left, i hope they didn't confiscated it
i hope nobody got shot to death, i hope nobody bleedin
i hope they didn't come through dumpin with they street-sweepers sweepin
put to rest, layin in the mortuary in there sleepin
put a hole in the flesh, formaldehyde to stop the place from stinkin
drinkin vodka {?} coppin mo' (keys) than (alicia)
from yakama all the way to canada, they think i'm a janitor
man of the hour devour i'm mo' ready with some sour
slippin sticky, dowicky, smokin turtle with my partners chillin
ecstasy, dirty piss test test
cause he got five different drugs up inside of he
can't get a j-o-b, nobody wanna hire he
ex-con, parole with a felony
some of my dudes be smokin cloves
some of my dudes be powderin they nose
some of my dudes be off that kangaroo
some of my dudes be drunk like me and you
some of my dudes be off that nave
that's that shit them city boys done fucked around and made
some of my dudes be off that lean
that prescription, that syrup, that codeine
this a man's game
this a man's game pimp, this a man's game
ooooh
