"7 much"
(feat. kokane)
doin too much (too much), seven much (too much)
don't you know that i'm the one
you can't get nothin over on me
doin too much (too much), way too much (too much)
you doin too much - i'm the one
i see you over there peepin a player out from hella far away
tryin to get with some of this here mackin
apparently you ain't tryin hard enough cause if you was
you woulda been made your way over here to the v.i.p. with us
where yo' man at?  what's the matter with that clown
leavin a sharp-ass lil' broad like you up in here with all us players?
hopefully you up in here with some of yo' friends, so some of my friends
can get with some of yo' friends and turn it into somethin
i'm - fin' to walk over here to the bar and get the bartender
to mix me one of my customized drinks without the blender
get everybody up in the club up in here off the numb-numb juice
vodka, 7-up, and cran-apple juice (eww)
the ladies outnumber the fellas six-to-one
and me and my fellas up in here like good one pimp, we all won
the pretty ones in here are hot like a dog in heat
touchin they toes, backin it up, and dancin like a freak
man!  i'm over here on super-purp' (super-purp')
up in the club hollerin at somebody else's work
yeah pimpin i'm up on all the slang that you make up
but i believe you stay about your marbles and be about your bacon
youse a player about yours and i'm sensin and smellin
that youse one of them sharp-ass lil' sisters huh?
might even want you to be my baby, maybe ma
speakin upon my baby ma, here she comes
and she hoodrat, hoodrat, hoochie momma
same ol', same ol', dry-ass drama (drama)
comin up in my face about the, child support
talkin about, takin me to court (to court)
eww eww eww, takin me to court, can't work me
most of these hoes be mo' full of shit than a christmas turkey
well alright ho
boss mo', player hater hater my noggin
d-boy, people swear up and down i'm a rocker
but i'm a soil block turf hog built for battle
15's in the trunk, like a snake they rattle
leave skid marks all on the gravel
drivin like a bat outta hell to the hotel
bounce roll rock skate side to side
baby got the gin and the astroglade (and the astroglade)
i hopin that the jimmy don't bust
while i thrust much cush gush knock boots with lust
swish swush loose nuts drop juice drip stuff
one two three fo' five six seven much!
baby baby baby baby you doin too much (and all the fellas say)
ah la la la la, la la (and all the ladies say)
ohh la la la la, la la (and all the fellas say)
ohh la la la la, la la (and all the ladies say)
ohh la la la la, la la (and all the fellas say)
ohh la la la la, la la (and all the ladies say)
