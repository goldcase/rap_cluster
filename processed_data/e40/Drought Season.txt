"drought season"
(feat. kaveo)
yeah e-40 and the muthafuckin c-l-i-c-k in this muthafucka, you know
i got my cousin kaveo on the muthafuckin side of me
we fin to spit some of this old flamboyant shit,  check game-
it's another one of them drought spots, a ha-bin cost is like fuck it
niggaz taken loses that they can't make up
gettin gaffled for some of that shit call cake-up
strechin the crap, making a bad batch
the screen from a trweekers pipe turns black
so they go crazy, get hot-headed, start actin' a fool yellin'
but ya'll know there ain't no refunds in the shit that i'm sellin
cuz during the drought season niggaz be lookin' for a reason to rush ya
so i suggest you put up your bootsees man and pull out your buckets
here's another part of this shit that a niggaz up lift about the game
the drought season main, cuz this shit here never remains the same
and a brother ain't about to let his muthafuckin capital go mein
so instead he gots to get scandlous
cuz he can't keep up and handle hisbuisness
like he use to and he ain't really wit being through, get to it dude
gotta pull a straight come-up, lick
catchin' muthafuckas outta bounds swerv,
breakin they punk ass leavin scared
cuz this is the type of shit that occur
so don't get caught loose on perv
i gots meals, wheels, and about 5 thousand dollars worth of bills
bank account way on the red, fuckin with the highest overhead
jackin off my money yo ass is out boy and i promise you that
i'm a money hungry muthafucka and i'm so serious about my scratch
so you're best bet is
to check yourself before you wreck yourself punk botch
i gets down and dirty like dr. ruth and i put that on the gooch
droppin muthafuckas just like a bad habit, dag nab it
tricks wanna get outta line i let 'em have it
now bag it, i gots ice cream candy
and all kinds of things of that flavor
and maybe later i might be willing to go low as long as you buyer before
cuz i'm the only muthafucka with a-1 yola,
none of that ol caken with baking soda
it gets released, ceased, and then the prices rises like yeast
those who gots leftovers will become obese,
triplin' my mail off the triple beam scale
i even got enemies with envy askin' me for yayo
chorus -
the drought season niggaz lookin' for a reason
it's like thanksgiving without the feast -n
a niggaz tryin to work hard on a meal ticket so i can't stand to be dry
cuz after the stronger man supply
but in the drought season it's too hard to get by
niggaz be runnin' off with d gafflin muthafuckas, startin at chances
cuz a niggaz mail ain't to muthafucka fancy,
rollin around with a duece and a quarter
can't get caught lose on the border, sittin on them thangs like 40
stay fuckin with a bitches brain
can't be affected by the great depression
this country is in a recession, i reckon
so let me give yo ass a funky lesson-
never let a muthafucka know what you got or what you buyin
it's dem bootsee muthafuckas in your town that's always dyin'
stay low, play the background, keep your shit on a hush mate
hit it hard one time and then hibernate
now check game i'm tryin to do my own muthafuckin' thang
but shit just ain't right
for heaters that just got way to tight, jackin muthafucka's on sight
but i'm a nigga that don't give a fuck
when i'm tryin to get my cashflow up
and render them seasons what ever the reason may be, niggaz comin up
short tye, gag, watch em short out from sea,
for sale signs on a nigga's shit
cuz he ain't got no muthafuckin' d,
sellin' up everything made of material g
the drought season
i'm really not all sure about them thangs that fin to mature
but let me find me a nigga with a grip and hit his ass quick with a lick
what's your definition of a lick?
takin' a niggas shit
hey, put that on sumptin
i put that on the click,
if you consider yourself a hustla can't be no busta brown
stackin mail, straight come upin', when funk come around be down
a nigga's gotta have some type of hustle
whether it be sellin' dank or robbin banks
snitches can't go to the pen  cuz they fuck around and wind up shanked
in the presence of drought season shit gets hectic
niggaz losin they lives when they least expect it
it's e-40 and my cousin kaveo lettin' muthafuckas know main
spittin that ol shit that muthafuckas don't understand an
tardy to the crazy ass game, never gotta be clever
specially in this type of weather, ya know?
the drought season
thought he had cane but it was gold medal flour
