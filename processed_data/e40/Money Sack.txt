"money sack"
(feat. lil boosie)
aaaw shit
aye, yo, farty, i'm home, nigga
welcome home, family
felt deep in the cut, dawg, groovie
four real niggas, four roogas
money on my mind as we bung straight boosin'
straight boosin' that new bay music
party on my lap as i cruise with my bad chick
bad chick, bad chick, badder than my last chick
all my dudes, we spark a lot
but we tottin' big pistols in the parkin' lot
we on that dum' dum' dum' dum' dum' dum' shit
my side ride or die on that where ya from shit?
east oakland, where ye at, thug?
whip it whip it whip it bring it back plug
real nigga, ye ain't even gotta ask us
lost sum' real niggas so i'm tattered up
shy town pass so i'm 'get it up'!
niggas on the benz slidin' one lead eye
woke up this mo'ning like fuck that (fuck it fuck fuck it fuck that shit)
man, it's time to get my money sack (i said man, it's time to get my money sack)
hustle hustle hustle hustle hustle
hustle hustle hustle hustle hustle
hustle hustle hustle hustle hustle
woke up this mo'ning like fuck that
opened up a loud pack and rolled a baseball bat
this that power, that skunk, took a shower and grabbed my corpesmith
a western 4-5th, leave a bitch nigga stiff
from the beginning, my nigga, fo' i was straight to go
i was plottin' on dope when i was hittin' briah
tried to make an honest dolla, didn't work fo' me
so i did what i had to do for my family
we on that dum' dum' dum' dum' dum' dum' shit
hit a bitch nigga with a drum stick
draggin' my knuckles on the crown like an ape
tougher than the three dolla state
psychedelic colors in my presidential
i'm a real one, i ain't got no bitch potential
raised in a drug infested environment
free all of my real ones and solitary confinements
woke up this mo'ning like fuck that (fuck it fuck fuck it fuck that shit)
man, it's time to get my money sack (i said man, it's time to get my money sack)
hustle hustle hustle hustle hustle
hustle hustle hustle hustle hustle
hustle hustle hustle hustle hustle
my money sack, my money sack
gettin' that money sack
hey! out here gettin' it
baby, show 100 stacks
nigga, fuck that nigga, bitch!
aye aye aye aye aye aye aye
bitch!
woke up this mo'ning like fuck that (fuck it fuck fuck it fuck that shit)
man, it's time to get my money sack (i said man, it's time to get my money sack)
hustle hustle hustle hustle hustle
hustle hustle hustle hustle hustle
hustle hustle hustle hustle hustle
