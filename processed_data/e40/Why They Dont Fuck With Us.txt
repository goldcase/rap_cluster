"why they don't fuck with us" lyrics
e-40 lyrics
"why they don't fuck with us"
y'all ready for this
are you ready!!!!!!
ho, uh, uh
why they don't fuck with us
don't fuck with us, don't fuck with us
don't fuck with us
i use colorful rhymes, you probably heard
from somebody else's lit, but really it's my spit
i came from the streets, i'm not from the 'burbs
although i stay in the burbs, i come from the streets
money hungry hustlers trying to make ends meet
stingy young brothers when we walk we squeak
have street, have money, have heart
i ain't trying to but i'm trying to go off the park
i'm on deck, sick wid it records i rep
i'm a vet, but i spit  like a youngster from the set
i ain't tripping, i knew it was political
they left us out the top for us, me and mystikal
i rap fast but you could quote my rhymes
the greatest game spitter of all times
the most underrated rapper in the game
but everybody wanna use my slang
i don't know what they was thinking
when they thought what they was thinking
but they shit enough to fuck it
i've been a hustler since birth
so when they haul me off and
put me up in that hearse remember this verse
i did a song with fred durst, as far as the independent
underground rap scene, i was the first
to get a big deal, couple mill, and some mo'
see times have changed ever since then back in '94
playa been eating off that bill, for a while
i always did me i never changed my style
i gave it to you raw and uncut
75 percent of the words, i made it up
you ask me why i speak the real the way i feel
how come e-40 so groupie and y'all so game goofy
started to the back that i'm a force
they never put me on the cover of the source
next tape, they can't trace the calls
i change numbers, like a playa changes draws
i'm having money, money long stretch like a ?burshie?
when he use to come around ask the easter bunny
(tell me do you know e-40)
bet you the players say that's the homie
you liable to find me on the ave. on the main drag
or on the corner sipping yac up out a brown paper bag
i don't need no iron on my ready crease
enough game to sell sand to a beach
enough game to sell a hooker to a priest
enough game to sell rookie rocket scottie to a street
i rap fast but you could quote my rhymes
the greatest game spitter of all times
the most underrated rapper in the game
but everybody wanna use my slang
