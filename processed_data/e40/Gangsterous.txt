"gangsterous"
(feat. d-shot, the mossie)
we gangsterous, we gangsterous (gangsterous)
we gangsterous, we gangsterous (gangsterous)
we gangsterous, we gangsterous (gangsterous)
we gangsterous, we gangsterous (gangsterous)
well let me start again with a stiff chin, go 'head and take one
i just begun, to break yo' ass off a lump sum
with double i's, i got a (??) in the garage
and ready to mob, so get the fuck up out of dodge
before i trip, and slap yo' ass with this new grip
one slip of the tongue'll get your monkey ass hung
two lungs is what it takes to inhale the dank
and one cap is all it takes to put you in the paint
so beware, to stare, in the glare, of this infrared
you dread the day we pull out the glock display
one way, is what your headed down, we got the pound
so bow down, and give me the ball because we on the mound
pitchin heat, finsta treat you to this gangster shit
break a bitch, hog niggaz take a shit
pitchin heat, finsta treat you to this gangster shit
break a bitch, hog niggaz take a shit
wha-da-da-dey, wha-da-da-da-dang
hustlin on the thirteen-hundred block slangin 'caine
carquenez bridge, mini-14, thats gangster shit
with walkie-talkies and po-po scanners on the lookout for the pigs
i make long bread, i brought big cars
everybody know the hustle, it's like i'm a movie star
but in the middle of the night, out the mouth they foam
jumpers be knockin on my bedroom window
with they cats with they friendly spook on talkin about
"can i borrow some fetti?  loan me a dimepiece til the first"
and i be like, you mean to tell me yo' uppity ass
ain't got no money in yo' purse?
"nah but i got a bic"  a bic?
some dopefiend matches, a little bit of that and she'll suck yo' dick
she's a bootch, she fat, she out there bad
i promise you somethin proper lil' diva, the dick pleaser
the neighborhood head doctor, i give a fuck about a chickenhead cluck
i'm tryin to get papered up, i'm gangsterous
we import chickens from the japanese
drop 'em off to the young homies
if they come up short, we breakin knees, spines and spleens
killers on the team greated at the age of thirteen
by all means makes niggaz buy cream from us
triple beam dreams is a motherfuckin must
we slide through in a tough, black expedition truck
if a nigga cross game they get ripped and bucked
buck 'em up, lay 'em down nigga, we for the figures
if your money bigger, we got yo' head behind the trigger
cough it up nigga, we want the combo to the safe
give it up nigga, before i catch a murder case
(??) it up nigga, ain't no survivors so realize it
a half a ki, in the trunk is all mine, so penalize it
i hit the block, serve a flock of that, good white girl
bust 'em down, bag 'em up and serve the whole damn world
we gangsterous
bitches on niggaz, let them think they got game
we sent them hoes, them hoes know bob by they name
we put the p's in the pimpin, the s in the scandalous
i understand that niggaz is quick to trick
that's why i supply and deliver
if the bitch don't perform, i gotta acquit her
send her to the mall or somethin
in the trunk in richmond mall or somethin
gangsters, hoes down baby
here we come ridin, pullin up in mercedes
steppin through flossin campaignin like the president
straight to v.i.p., we all-american
gangsters, hoes down baby
here we come ridin, pullin up in mercedes
steppin through flossin campaignin like the president
straight to v.i.p., we all-american
