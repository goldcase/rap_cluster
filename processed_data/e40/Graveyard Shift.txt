"graveyard shift"
(feat. cousin fik & choose up cheese)
graveyard shift d-boys don't quit
when the sun goes down it's still money to get
grave-graveyard shift d-boys don't quit
when the sun goes down it's still money to get
graveyard shift d-boys don't quit
when the sun goes down it's still money to get (graveyard shift)
grave-graveyard shift d-boys don't quit
when the sun goes down it's still money to get (the graveyard shift)
uhh, i was out there on the scene
she pulled up, "you doin anything? " uhh
"you know i'm good for it
tomorrow is the first you know i can afford it" uhh
at four am in the morning anything goes
the court smoke crack, the rich powered they nose (they nose?)
the po-po shift change (shift change)
hustlin' in the rain (in the rain)
sirens and ambulances
it was stuck in the storm mane he swallowed a half an ounce
momma yellin' and screamin' top of her lungs
in the middle of the street, god why did you take my son? (wahhhhh)
crime scenes and things the choir sings
at the funeral service they catered it with churches (with churches)
chicken that is (chicken)
back to biz i'm on the graveyard shift
can i get a witness?
my shop don't close i'm like 24 hour fitness
anytime anything i got it
tell me what'chu and need and we can meet by sonic's
i don't sleep i'm in insomniac
the nigga with the jug, they call me that
soon as they leave, they call me back
like same thang mane where you get that at?
i go hard, cookin' and whippin'
if you need some love, you know i ain't trippin'
doing the graveyard, i really slang hard
got blue light specials like k-mart
bay smarts, stock gang
and i keep that gas, heatane
no sleep, i'm up till dawn
i need hunds i'm about my funds
cousin fik, listen, uh
bitch black on the streets
ain't nobody out but fiends and police
a roach, a rat, a couple straight cats
and they escalade flats from a couple of straight caps
uh, chicken maiden the v
it's where a knock can get a hit for they three (uh-huh)
a nigga a take off your dome (what else)
hit a house lick where everybody home (home invasions?)
emergency room with pats
somebody else done got smacked (bop bop bop bop bop bop bop)
read it an hour later
vallejo time carrel online paper (on the computer)
shit is scary like a cemetery
the graveyard shift can lead to preliminaries
cause the dark a always find you (what about...)
walking by yourself feel the streets behind you on that
graveyard shift d-boys don't quit
when the sun goes down it's still money to get
