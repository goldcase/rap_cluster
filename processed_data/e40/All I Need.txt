"all i need" lyrics
e-40 lyrics
"all i need"
(all that i)
(this world)
let these fools know
(you been so good to me)
the game's been good to me
my fans been good to me
the money been good to me
all i need though is this shit
talkin about i be rappin off track
some of you square suckers be tryina say e-40 wack
do your due dilligence in your research 'fore i pimp my pen
if you ain't never lived it and done it, you can't comprehend
i'm a fixture, a factor, somethin that you ain't
respect my rank, you got none of that, point blank
i'm one of your favorite mc's favorite mc
ask they ass, they know me
bet you they tell you "that boy right there got flows and creativity
that's the big homie"
i'm authentic and real, i'm far from bein phoney
originality is a must whenever i bust
before i got into the rap game i was hustlin on the hush
rock it up (?) dust, same color as pie crust
penitentiary chances, shackles, chains and handcuffs
the first rapper talkin about triple-beam scales
choppers, drought seasons and shit like that
i got some real niggas that'll vouch for that
might not know how to freestyle but my rhymes'll paint a picture
fuck bein a lyricist, i'm a fuckin game spitter
pandemonium and chaos the price of bein a boss
that come with the package, i'm a savage, slightly throwed off
grew up on $hort and freddie b, magic mike and calvin t
dolemite and blowfly, krs and ice-t
melle mel and spoonie, just to name a few
utfo, kool herc and afrika bambaataa, too
(you been so good to me)
the game's been good to me
my fans been good to me
the money been good to me
g-o-d been good to me
you all i need
you all i need
you all i need
you all i need
i paved the way for indie labels
ask master p and birdman what i brought to the table
out the trunk independently
sold hundreds of thousands of records with no video or airplay
me and my uncle st. charles
suga, d-shot, legit, the click, legends in this shit
but hold up, it don't stop there
if i got a dollar for every word i made up i'd be a billionaire
i'm the past and the present
i was sayin shit 20 years ago y'all niggas just now sayin
i done seen rappers come and go
get they 15 minutes of fame, then you don't hear about them no mo'
yeah, i done had my ups and downs
but the cold part about it is e-40 still around
i don't know why these suckers keep sayin i need to get my mumblin ass out the way
when i got a passion for rappin, partner, i don't do it just for pay
you oughta come to one of my concerts, you oughta come to one of my shows
i do my old school and my new school songs and all of them bitches go
they don't build 'em like me no mo', i'm a motherfuckin pro
a living legend, collection of classics, thought that you should know
you can't erase me out of history
i'm from the same place as cc
(?) vallejo california, if you blink you might miss it
(you been so good to me)
the game's been good to me
my fans been good to me
the money been good to me
g-o-d been good to me
you all i need
you all i need
you all i need
you all i need
third verse, more than half my life
since teenagers, i gotta thank my wife
since we was little young cubs
born in the struggle, broke, livin off of love
this is the actual, not a non-theatrical movie
i thank god for my sons, issue and droop-e
even though they divorced, my mama and my daddy
my sister, my brothers, my cousins and my family
i love y'all, and my fans when they hated
were down with my futuristic ass way before i made it
and all my real ones with some balls
went out funkin, beefin, feudin, niggas made some phone calls
ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta - pow!
ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta - pow!
ratata-tat, put him on his back
bust a sucker head (?)
the rap game's been good with me
stuck when me when i didn't even have a penny
you lames can say what you like
but i been in it for 22, i gotta be doin somethin right
that means i'm not a overnight
overnight sensation, didn't happen over night
i broke barriers for independence, mayne, i set the tone
they probably won't 'preciate me till i'm gone
(you been so good to me)
the game's been good to me
my fans been good to me
the money been good to me
g-o-d been good to me
you all i need
you all i need
you all i need
you all i need
(you been so good to me)
