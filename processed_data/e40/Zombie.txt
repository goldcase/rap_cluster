"zombie"
(feat. tech n9ne & brotha lynch hung)
if you're zombie,
if you're zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend,
if you're...
lynch, e-40,
it's that season of the sickness your witnessing nigga sittin spin (fuck you),
i'm a get you addicted when i spit shit venomous shit, shit again,
shit so much i gotta go to costco to get my toilet paper,
hit so much, spit so much with the pistol up, i'm a skitzo nut,
reap a raper keep her safe or he could take her,
chill pill, real deal, kill bill,
i might be sick,
but that ain't the reason that i still spit real i'll,
niggas ain't got no lyrics when i hear it
i'm like "what's up with that" everybody wanna copy me,
so i'm choppin em up leave rotten meat,
(if you're zombie)
i'm a be drama free like my momma be,
suicide before i let a nigga ride on me, that ain't comedy (i'm bullshit),
i don't get, i don't have to get it,
mini ak, i call him midget,
and he got a sister heatin em up makin his skin blister,
i'm a monster your a zombie.
if you're zombie,
if you're zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend,
if you're...
i'm lookin out the window when it's thundering and lighting
in 2 in the afternoon the sky is black and it's frightening,
there howling, looking n prowling, growling,
back we're smiling, crowding,
around my place,
gimme 40 feed and a house of space,
before i bust you in the face,
witch thumper, thumper,
pack 3 guns like a hunter, hunter,
kick a nigga ass like a putter, putter,
beat a muthafucka like a drummer, drummer,
base play crazy half a hate a hazy,
4 game like the gracie's,
i a monster, i'm a fiend on the microphone,
walk into my twilight zone,
play me foul get tombstoned,
send you to hell where you belong,
gonna wish ya had a muthafuckin snow cone, no coat on,
i got the wickedest flow,
serve a muthafucka take out to go,
send a hubba head to a sucka front door, lynch n 40 water nina in this hoe.
if you're zombie,
if you're zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend,
if you're...
if your a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend,
if your a zombie see your lovin every way tech, lynch and 40 sing,
see ya gotta be conscious of what it means,
then i know that your ready for what it brings,
do you know what i mean when i say caribou lou,
then your tellin me tech nina go ahead and do you,
do ya never get enough of nina and you listen when you with the crew,
kct you know and just what it do,
your ass probly startin to moshpit,
lovin every minute of bangin this boss shit,
you throwin up your set around all cliques,
you never wanna be hangin with a soft bitch,
you know who you are muthafuckas.
if you're zombie,
if you're zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend,
if you're...
