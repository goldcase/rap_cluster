p226 diana ross cousin nina
misdemeanor, that's what we do, understand it
i be more hipper than a hippopotamus
get off in your head like a neurologist
pushin more weight than atlas
got a partner by the name of 2pacalypse
the seven-oh-seven my roots go hella far back to flor terrace
i pull a forty out of my ballcap
and den i flush it down my esopha-garus
the group that i'm with the click
suga, d-shot, legit
family orientated
game related, it's the shit
killing motherfuckers off crucial
sittin em down mutual
running through these lyrics as if i was fibered
like metamucil

sprinkle me main, sprinkle me main, sprinkle me main, sprinkle me main
big timah timah, big timah.... forty wata-ahh

ya gotta strut that's a gang of shot (gang of shot)
ooh ooh ooh i'm a fool
slangin more mail as i smobs through yo' hood
straight shakin all, these bustas and busterettes
tryin to claim fame off my chavez rep (chavez rep)
ohh, why oh why must i be so tight? (why oh why)
most folks tell me, suga you ain't right
(why oh why suga you ain't right)
it makes me wanna scream while i make ya holla
pullin a gang of clout like that al-mighty dollar
