"barbarian"
i'm a barbarian a savage, fully and semi automatic
a manage hustler with the package, rock like lenny kravitz
on a mission about my mail, petulant, chicken, burney's and 12's
rob a nigga if i have to, if all else fails
but that ain't really my get-down plus i'm the new laws of nature
it might not come back on me now but this will come back on me later
i'm from it, built for battle the bay maybe in peace
same levis for weeks 501's, no crease
i pack a cannon, 44 like clint eastwood cha see
a cannon? yeah but not the cannon camera 7d
i'm whiskey, office landy
i don't know when i'll be sober again
i'm just not falling down from the sky finally coming down off my high
if it wasn't for the water the rap game will be dry
so i feed the soil life resuscitate the game
breave life back in every real nigga that we lost mane
uh, he an animal, a beast
he don't eat, nigga he feast
"you're a barbarian, a savage"
"you're a barbarian, a savage"
same jeans, for weeks
out here with the zombies, fiends and tweeks
"you're a barbarian, a savage"
"you're a barbarian, a savage"
do the development while i might better tetch it don't wanna get caught loose
some of these niggas are i'll when they get on pills and courage juice
alot of these dudes ain't real lot of us cats are synthetic
swivel, canap√© yeah nigga i said it
i just screw up on top of suckers up on my solid dude list
now i don't need no liabilities, i can't be taking the risk
gotta say i found, go hard like them marion barbarians
what is beef? can be no vegan or vegetarian
in the streets, i kinda hardly to let the palm trees mislead
can i hear what that tough guy had activity will bleed'cha
every time i look around i hear the streets blocked up
it's just like where you say send ya back in the pine house
i take my shirt off in this bitch, stretch marks and all
turn into sumthing, put my back against the wall
dig the chalking i'm punching i'm try'na break a nigga jaw
keep swinging and swinging until my enemy fall
beotch!
mommy and daddy never home so we raised ourselves
no dental plan, medical insurance and health
so i'm out here with these zombies, dope fiends and tweeks
bodies in the streets, covered with sheets
unlicensed drunk drivers, sex offenders apprise
suppose to be stay folks sinners and backslides
it ain't for play, one thing about los angeles, san diego and the bay
we quick to throw it all away in one day
over some he say she say
lock me up and throw the key away give me l.i.f.e.
give a fuck i'm a diet hero came my mentality
be a barbarian till i'm old and grey for eternity
ghetto celebrity, hey, specializing selling d
but right now it's a drought, so i'm selling tree
zips, zaps, zubbles, peas for three
thow-wow a pound, nigga holla at me, beotch
