"entrepreneur"
(with too $hort)
i got a plug on the white, a bitch sellin pussy
my partner got dvds and hood movies
i can get the j's before they come to the store
bitch, i'm a entrepreneur
he was born with spitt'ms
the gift of gab, izm
mattress on the floor, borderline poor
who woulda thought he'd be a entrepreneur?
he used to always say his blessings
liked to ask a lotta questions
look like a square but he got a lotta street knowledge
hung around addicts, gangsters and alcoholics
when he first started off
a young intern, but a soon-to-be boss
found himself, cause he used to be lost
cooler than fan belt, cold like a cough
dottin his i's and crossin his t's he be poppin his p's
internationally known in the states and all overseas
he be  or pushin bags of blow
he got 'em wonderin what he do like tommy from martin show
they lock niggas up all over the land
now we affiliated to county jails and pens
get anything you want, just like that
i'm tryina get some money, i ain't tryina go back
gotta stay on the street, keep the fam straight
it's hundreds to get, grands to make
stackin for a whip, waitin to get
paint and rims, then lift that bitch
28's, i'ma ride real big
choppin up game with my real nig
i know it's hell bein broke
but you gotta stop sellin that coke
sooner or later, can't do it forever
need a new hustle, still gettin that cheddar
mo' paper, less penitentiary chance
all you need is a business plan
where they at?
shout-out to the money makers
(to the money makers)
if you a hustler
(what about 'em?)
then you a entrepreneur
(a entrepreneur)
that's written, mane
scared money don't make no money
invest in yourself, mane
ya understand me?
it's a lotta opportunities out there, mane
ya got your health and your life and your strength, mane
go get it, breh
