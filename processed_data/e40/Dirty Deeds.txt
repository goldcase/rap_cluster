"dirty deeds"
"40-h2o, i got a few ends, can we do some kind of business mate?"
it depends on how much you wanna spend
and how much profit i'm gon' make
what's the crazy? sellin half a kezy, right now they go for eight
but you know we in the middle of a drought playboy,
so tomorrow might be too late
prices keep on elevatin,
escalatin and fluctuatin like oprah winfrey's weight
hesitatin, eliminatin competitor's competition out the gate
peruvian flake, cotton candy yams and highway 5
about an estimated four-and-a-half hour drive, let me go
na na, can't do that, too dangerous, too young
back off, it's a commotion, might even swallow your tongue
how?!? i'll tell ya later, hop your ass in this kezy
where we headed? venice beach
gotta go pick up our greasy ex-po po martial arts expert
money on grip and desperate, nuttin to be reckoned with
i tell you motherfuckers she's a fool
damn she sound like a fuckin nut
let's bust her potna and get the fuck
we smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin e's
livin life as a criminal doin a bunch of dirty deeds
(look here)
we smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin e's
livin life as a criminal doin a bunch of dirty deeds
(whatcha do?)
doin a bunch of dirty deeds
it ain't gon' be no cakewalk, so whatever ya do don't talk
others been sufficed to triangular markers with numbers on em
and bodies outlined in chalk
bodies outlined in chalk, triangular markers with numbers on em
and bodies outlined in chalk
call them organs, call my lawyer while you're at it
tell my gal get that dope up out the attic
we ism, i caught the po-po tryin ta spoil it
too much narcotics to be flushin down the toilet
these bitches talkin bout some shit i never knew about
some shit i never heard, some shit that i could sue about
knew i was in pittsburgh promotin a charity concert wit my weep
and luckily a motherfucker like me
had enough common sense to keep the receipt
35th and room service
buffalo wings and bleu cheese dressing, caesar salad
a glass of wine and lots of sexin, don't you doubt it
25 percent bookworm, 150 percent street smart
makin business, accusations only reach a start
we smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin e's
livin life as a criminal doin a bunch of dirty deeds
(watcha do?)
we smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin e's
livin life as a criminal doin a bunch of dirty deeds
(uhh)
doin a bunch of dirty deeds
as soon as i could walk i'd cooked up bout half a meal ticket
at the age of 17 years old fuckin em up like that
ovulatin in the kettle loft cos i kept watchin the game
i'd fall in the yard
operation desperation, go get your fetti,
daddy slingin niggas who off
in front of the liquor store tryin to get somebody
to buy me a bottle and a pack of newports
so that a motherfucker can up-chuck on the teacher
when i get to school, restricted
so move up out of the classroom, better yet after school to diss this
hella quick tip, wit extra manners, tie your ass up wit the phone cord
duct tape your mouth, talk to your ass in spanish
describe me voice, like me no speak no english
take me razorblade and get to choppin at your fingers
straight killers new to my squadron
my deuce don't even know that's on my squadron's back
godzilla ballers, a juvenile with damn man respect
craze up off the set, pistol whippin negroes wit my tek
nina millimetre heater, heavy metal wet
crushin heads and snappin necks, causin nosebleeds
a 150 percent street nigga about dem dirty deeds
we smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin e's
livin life as a criminal doin a bunch of dirty deeds
(whatcha do?)
we smoke trees and slang ki's, off the fuckin e's
livin life as a criminal doin a bunch of dirty deeds
(whatcha do?)
doin a bunch of dirty deeds
