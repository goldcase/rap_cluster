"2 fingers"
(feat. adrian marcel)
this the business
you used to be sweet as honey, used to be my honey
but switched up when my money started getting funny
got ya partners all in your ear now your beer is beer
used to throw up toast up cheers now its nothing but tears
you bad as fuck with a big ol butt but your attitude fucked up
guess all them likes on your selfies bitch got ya mind all fucked up
you know me, all my life i been real, never phony
gou gon' fuck around and make me fuck one of your homies
biatch!
you got me fucked up
what part of you will say fuck love
cause you be on that fuck stuff
and i'm tired of your shit
it's never love at first sight
it was only lust on the first night
should've known then you wouldn't be right
but i had to give you a try
how was i supposed to know
that you were gonna tell me i was lousy
you had me in the dirt
while you look me in my face i
me and you alone
even though i'm trying to hide inside
damn it really hurts
my heart to keep your place
i'm giving you
2 fingers girl
2 fingers girl
2 fingers girl
move on
one's for the pain, all the drama, the trouble
2's for the tears that i cry when i loved you
2 fingers girl
2 fingers girl
2 fingers girl
move on
tears in a bucket
cause fuck it we over
always remember that i really loved you
oh yeah
then you turn around and play me
talk this shit
oh really?
still i was that one that held you down
gave you my heart
you said my heart wasn't much
girl i never ran the game on you
cause i was too in love with
how?
how i'm supposed to know?
that you were gonna tell me i was lousy?
dragged me in the dirt
still look me in my face, i
me and you alone
even though i try to hide inside
damn it really hurts
some things you can't replace
i'm giving you
2 fingers girl
2 fingers girl
2 fingers girl
move on
ones for the pain all the drama, the trouble
2'sd for the tears i cried when i loved you
2 fingers girl
2 fingers girl
2 fingers girl
move on
tears in a bucket girl, fuck it we over
always remember that i really loved you
you played with my heart you tempted to wipe your feet on
get out of my life get gone bitch for i slap you with this phone bitch
pack your bags and tear up out the soil i don't want your ungrateful ass no more
all these bitches i coulda had bitch i was faithful to your ass
showed you the other side of the game took you from state to state
200 a plate, lobster and srhimp scampi and a hot steak
before me you wouldn't know nothing about a quirksih field
just recently i was considering getting down on one knee
but now?
how i'm supposed to know?
that you were gonna tell me i was lousy?
dragged me in the dirt
still look me in my face, i
me and you alone
even though i try to hide inside
damn it really hurts
some things you can't replace
i'm giving you
2 fingers girl
2 fingers girl
2 fingers girl
move on
ones for the pain all the drama, the trouble
2's for the tears i cried when i loved you
2 fingers girl
2 fingers girl
2 fingers girl
move on
tears in a bucket girl, fuck it we over
always remember that i really loved you
