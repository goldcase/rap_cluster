"tell it like it is"
how can i help you
what can i do for ya
lookin’ for that china white
girl that’s soft
if i aint got it
i know where to find it
if i can get it for you
boss
how much you got in your budget
the more you buy the less it costs
i could front you a few off the side
as long as your ass don’t double cross
you crossed a lot of raccoons
get your cranium sawed off
i got mouths to feed my nigga
i can’t afford to take no loss
i can give your ass a number
it’s up to you to keep it quite
you can’t be a punk about nothin’
you gotta keep the money comin’
i’m out here
dealin’ with these suckers
stopin’ the fake ass
busters
they stab your ass in the back
these brothers turn on you
i know when it’s gonna get short
how long this sureness suppose to last
i aint got the weather channel
to predict the forcast
the plan is hustlin’
‘cause there ain’t no work there aint no job
so they stuck in playing this game
and the next thing they gonna rob
two faceded little ol’ heathen
workin’ with the law
man no matter what you do for nigga
they aint never gonna be satisfied
tell it like it is
my whole thing is like
why dudes be lettin’ cats get in their ear though
i’m just tellin’ it like it is
i don’t know what the fuck happened between ’96 up into now
nigga is hoes
i’ma tell it like it is
man nigga is going out backwards man
kill all this snitchin’my nigga what’s up with that
tell it like it is
if there was a snake it would’ve bite ya
see you’ve been fallowin’ so many nigga you wouldn’t even know what hit ya
now you don’t know which way to look
you don’t really know which way to turn
got you trying to protect yourself
with all the bridges you done burned
you nigga cry to us nowadays
nigga feelings get hurt too easily
might as well wear a tampon
might as well be a breezy
a closed mouth don’t get fed
and a lazy hustler don’t get bread
pimpin’ i can’t read minds
i don’t know what’s in your head
everybody think they know it all
wanna hear nobody speak
shut the fuck up and listen sometime
even if you an o.g.
personally i’m a grinder
let no grass grow under my feet
don’t nothin’ come to a sleeper
but a dream
a vision without a plan
is just a hallucination
i gotta lotta folks in the pen
programmin’
i’m gonna give it to you straight
i ain’t gonna give it to you late
i’ma tell your ass what’s real
i ain’t gonna tell ya nothin’ fake
man i got my own dreams
everybody wants me to finance theirs
tell it like it is
you know who i like i like that boy 40 man
he’s 20 years in the game and he consistent
just tellin’ it like it is
not all of them but allot of these new dudes is
ringtone rappers man
i’ma tell it like it is
fools just have one album out
and act like they just it
tell it like it is
same song third verse
it’s from the heart it aint rehearsed
the world is full of associates
but very few friends
that wanna contribute nothin’
but wanna help spend your ends
think before you rock yo mouth
park your tongue and lip
watchin who you talkin’ round
never know who you’re havin’ dinner with
aint got nothing good to say
don’t say nothin’ at all
that’s what i was told
that’s what i was taught when i was small
a lot of theses so called artists got too much
talent
you should be getting’ your money on
instead of hatin’ on the next man
it’s lonely at the top
but it’s next to crowed at the bottom
tha’s why i always keep my pistol cocked
in case i gotta stop em’
...
trunk full of slap
hollerin’ at em’ back
pocket full of scraps
nothin’ but thousand stacks
i’m old school
actin’ a fool makin’ my presence known
i look at business face to face
don’t like to talk on phones
when i’m at a stop sign or a red light
i leave one car space in front of me
tell it like it is
just so i could have enough room to get outta there
just in case someone try to pop at me or something
tell it like it is
that’s how i was raised
i’m still a student of the game
you could learn from a baby
i’ma tell it like it is
man i was hollerin’ at my grand partner
he said 40 return phone calls and you’ll keep your friends
tell it like it is
bitch
you two faceded ass mother fuckers
i didn’t just help create my music mother fucker
i invented it
everybody wanna know what the fuck mob music is
nigga this is mob music
poor ass mother fuckers
bitch
