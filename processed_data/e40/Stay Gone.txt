"stay gone" lyrics
e-40 lyrics
"stay gone"
rock, paper, scissors
last resort a dull butter knife
try'na get rich twice
taking my chances rolling the dice
grittin' all day
califor-nye-aye
where we love the kids but we don't play
like my nigga keak da sneak say
i make my money fast
i stay gone like the past
try'na make my money greener
greener than my grass
see that brall right there she got ass
i met this chick from poland
i'm all up in her colon
left the pussy swollen
when i was poking
i just need just one more sip to-to-to take home
i been in the streets i just can't leave em alone
make my money fast yeah i'm in my zone
better catch me while i'm moving baby i'm on the go
i stay gone
stay gone
i stay gone
stay gone
uhh!
it ain't enough hours in the day to get what i need done
the breadwinner of the family, the chosen one
imagine a car without a motor
i carry the world on my shoulder
errday since i was a kid age 12
throwing papers from vallejo times herald
on the hillside of vallejo
i went to franklin junior high
english and reading not always fail
but when it came to math i was the god
uhh, i be busy
i ain't got time to watch tv
i ain't got time to play call of duty
i ain't got time to watch a movie
i ain't got time to listen to what's going on in your home i got problems on my own
beatch!
i just need just one more sip to-to-to take home
i been in the streets i just can't leave em alone
make my money fast yeah i'm in my zone
better catch me while i'm moving baby i'm on the go
i stay gone... stay gone
i stay gone... stay gone
i stay gone
stay gone
i stay gone
stay gone
uhh!
i got gouda to get that's what i told my tendo
i'll be gone till decembo
about a half a year
don't nothing come to a sleeper but a nightmare
i'm a hustler not a loser
try'na make our lifes better for the future
i'm a pimp polly gamish up in curle
on my way to the nevtherlands, amsterdam, eurail
me and a couple of my hoe bitches
finna go in to buisness
no bullshit all legit
brought the step-up shop in the red light district
the red light district like ludacris' song?
yeah, and i'll be sending y'all some money home
i'll fly ya out if your horny i know you goin be lonely
but if ya cheat on me i'm going upside your dormitory
beotch!
i just need just one more sip to-to-to take home
i been in the streets i just can't leave em alone
make my money fast yeah i'm in my zone
better catch me while i'm moving baby i'm on the go
i stay gone... stay gone
i stay gone... stay gone
i stay gone
stay gone
i stay gone
stay gone
