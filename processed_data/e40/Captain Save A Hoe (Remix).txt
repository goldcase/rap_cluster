"captain save a hoe (remix)"
(feat. the click)
ah is a, ah is a
should i save her (i wanna be saved)
ah is a, ah is a
should i save her (i wanna be saved)
ah is a, ah is a
should i save her (i wanna be saved)
it's 1994 and fools need to miss me be savin' these foes
you know how these tricks be, be buyin' em' clothes
wanna taxi those on vogues with the beat
and have em' sittin' next to em' in the front seat
but not b see i'm a hog up out the v
and my motto is bust a batch and hit the throttle
to the smoke talkin' on my okie doe
world wide i got a clydes up in tokoyo
look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
what's that fool name? (captain save a hoe main)
more faster than a speeding bullet
to put on his cape and scared
i put the fake the fake the funk the funk
to me that's not the way to do it
captain mutha-f em' save a soul came to me
flexin' just like a little ol' batch
all up in front of my company
had to check him fast with an ear check dump and pumpin'
talkin' to him while i'm beatin' him down
pumpin' fear talkin' bout partner you gone retrospect something here
mr. super-snitch, mr. super-trick
yeah, you wanna kill me cause i tossed ya chick
you should had your cape on tight that night
cause a brother like the shot sho plugs em' right
and now yo batch is straight callin me lovin me
on the under for the porno star that i be
and don't you come in my face with that trick shhh
ya betta try some more shhh
i got the gift to grab any batch
that i want but i don't
cause batches now a days will get you caught up in some funk
oh no, i'm not tryin' to save you girls 'n
how come when i was broke you wasn't brown nosin'?
the other day you see me smobbin' down magazine
with some ol' sucker in your car lookin' at me mean
i stopped in the middle of the street
reached under seat to grab my heat
man that's the same ol' buster
that i got into it with at the club last week
man them suckers can't fade
they batch made
and so they start
but suckers with no heart
don't want no part to this
fool rollin' with the funk mobb
and when it's funk
the pump will spit them double laws
so what you doin' when we roll through you hideout
i let my mack get off and then i rides out
with your ass there smokin' like a dope fiend
you savin em' man and that's batch thang
i'm lovin' tricks when i'm pimpin'
and even snitches just for my riches
captain save me, it's all good if ya slippin'
it's all good as long as ya payin' yeah
it ain't my fault if you get sprung off my land
i'm takin' ga checks, go to the bank hank
if ya comin' faulty, you get ganked main
long as a trick comes fallin' down
that gets me all upset to put on my suit and clown
but make that man take care your kids
make that fella call your kids his
make that mark get out there and work
make him fool buy you a brinun burk
it's all part of that sucker take care of me
crevice whipped fool come save me
batches out there be on the look out
for captain save em' though
cause he's savin though
