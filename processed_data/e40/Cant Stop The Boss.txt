"can't stop the boss"
(feat. snoop dogg, too short & jazze pha)
ladies and gentlemen
you are now tuned in to the very best
of the phin-vale anton-tindale{?}
you can't stop the boss - like a runaway train
you can not stop me (stop me)
i'm on go and still in the game
you can not stop me - you can't stop the boss
this ain't no red light district
green lights i fly by
she say we look like pimpin
i say baby you know you can't stop the boss
the definition of a boss, let me put you up on it
b-o-s-s, bread over sucker shit
ain't too many left all the real ones done went away
i'm built from a different brick, i'm carved from a different clay
be careful what you wish, play the game for what it's worth
cause bein a boss can be a gift and a curse, uhh
hope for the best but expect the worst
they'd rather see you in a hearse than see you come in first
i'm gettin gouda my nigga, i'm havin paper my fella
man i get to it my nigga, man makin revenue hella
i'm a tell you like dis, like kenny red said
i'm havin everything that a king should have (beitch!)
i sell a dream
i'm hella clean, this the life you wish fo'
i'm comfortable, you can bump the flow
brains blew out, it's convertible
white walls, plush seats
i'm a boss at all costs, i must eat
vintage statute, grinnin at you
gold ones, continue spinnin at you
i'm a heavyweight, look at how i levitate
and perpetuate the rate of the golden state
my cousin earl knew i'm a set it straight
and set a date and meditate and regulate
you can try
but you can't stop me, i'll be doin alright
can't dilute cause i do it all night
i've been rappin on the mic my whole life
it's like i never stopped flowin, i keep goin
like a river where it ends you never knowin
i don't even think about it, i'm a workaholic
i date pretty young girls with perfect bodies
we bosses, gettin head in the office
all i do is cash checks and take offers
ask phalon, calvin or earl
when you see me they be countin the girls
