"questions"
(feat. droop-e)
c'mon tiger, i'm finna take you to school
up - put your seat belt on!
dad are you a hustler?
i guess you can say that, hustlin these records and tapes
where you get all these revenues?
hmm~! down and dirty about my scratch
and dad, why you always mean muggin?
i'm just tired of being stepped on son
dad are you a gangster?
i don't know, some people seem to think so~!
why you always carry that big ol' gat?
cause i'd rather be caught with than without
dad - tell me why you killed that man!
