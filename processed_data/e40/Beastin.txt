"beastin'"
uhhh!
i'm elevated
i floatin on cloud nine times outta ten you can find with a cup in my aid
filled to the rim with oil (illuminated oil) throwing up the middle finger
but i'm not an alcoholic i'm just a serious social drinker
they be thinking thumper coatin' don't trust nobody but i
cause the seamless be plotting and if they could theya try
like last night at the club, god is my witness
i was sitting at the table, minding my own business
living it up to the highest, like everyday is christmas
some sucka tried to try us, hating on our riches
i guess they didn't like us cause we got all the bitches
they didn't wanna fight us cause when niggas went to...
fuck compromising exampling and try to reason
we'll catch em outside of the club and leave em niggas leaking
i be beastin
and now you are about to witness...
i be beastin
(you be beastin mayne? hmmm)
beastin
i be beastin
(yeah, when i get in the local booth, and i get on that microphone...)
beastin
i be beastin
one long leap beasty i c, one long leap beasty i c
i be beastin
one long leap beasty i c, one long leap beasty i c
uhhh!
and now...
when my money was hecka small, i mean it looked like it was tall
punch a hater up in his jaw; he didn't wanna shake my paw
but i used to push that broad, on the other side of the law
when the price is fluctuating go up and down like a see-saw
but i didn't say no 'hee-haw' clown shit
this real i'll slap a busta with the hill on my hammer up out my skrill
i'll take a up-tempo track, put some gang behind my rap i'm like that
muthafucka i'm a mack hydro back
cause you fuck around get snatched i'm from the flats
the hillside to be exact (biatch!)
catting off and shipping ain't what this player do son
they're something like seven real niggas left on this earth and i'm one of them
i be beastin... manage lil ole heave
the rawest nigga speaking they call me earl stevens (biatch)
biatch!
and now you are about to witness...
i be beastin
(you be beastin mayne? hmmm)
beastin
i be beastin
(yeah, when i be up in the function, and i be filling that alcohol...)
beastin
i be beastin
one long leap beasty i c, one long leap beasty i c
i be beastin
one long leap beasty i c, one long leap beasty i c
uhhh!
and now...
uhhh!
bosses do what they want, suckas do what they can
ahh-uhh-ahh-uhh-uahhh! i'm feeling like tarzan
got a pocket full of money and i'm confident
got a fifth the landy cognac and some romulent
some romulent? yeah some cheeba
cause i only put my strategies of choice is a teeba (uhh!)
when she was young she wasn't looking all that tight take take meagan good for example
now she looking right
bout to take her down tonight, i be beastin in the bed
i like em darklight and bright, yellowbone in red
i'm loaded and i'm twisted and i'm faded
in the function getting white boy wasted (uhh!)
blanket suited pouted wounded
out my body something stupid
and now you are about to witness...
i be beastin
(you be beastin mayne? hmmm)
beastin
i be beastin
(damn right i brought my money mayne i need mine mayne)
beastin
i be beastin
one long leap beasty i c, one long leap beasty i c
i be beastin
one long leap beasty i c, one long leap beasty i c
uhhh!
and now...
