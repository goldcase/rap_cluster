public enemy lyrics
"say it like it really is"
get up
back atcha
gettin it on
still wide awake
6 in the mornin
still comin atcha
till the breaka dawn
this revolution goes on and on
stop that
askin
do we still rap?
do yall still scream?
yall still clap?
who dat
gonna tell yall we too old
but we still bold
and i got soul
its my birthday
and i'm fitty years...
quiet as kept
all them vjs and djs be old
their jobs sell the young
don't tell em what needs to be told
when they made pe
they broke the mold
didn't quit nothin
just hit the road
i just got back from soweto
you only know half of whatcha say you know
i know this records too hot for the radio
did yall hear what i said if you did
lets go
knock knock
we still here still doing our thing
public enemy
doing the right thing
we ain't just say any ol thing
just to get material things
i ain't sayin we ain't bought anything
stuck with the rapping
never tried to sing.
bring the noise raise the roof
they afraid of the youth
lookout, duckdown
(cant handle the truth)
now the club ain't no church
the church ain't no club
check them djs mixin up
murder and love
who shoulders the burdn
of all that murderin
the people
love spelled backwards is evol
misspelled
what the hell
the people get pain
dumbed from
another marketing campaign
its my birthday
we still killin the stage
i don't give a damn about poppin champaign
say what yall wanna say about
change
revolution i'm a say what i'm saying
rather be stuck up than stuck down
heres the difference
i picks up the black and brown
against mr man informants and government
while real people starve and cant pay their rent
they you seriously don't mean what you meant
i ain't tricked deceived paid off inagreement
somebody planned it
glad yall understand it
those that don't
headharded like granite
we look out for them too
and don't take em for granted
like said
somebody planned it.
if i see one more person
gonna ask me
again'
yall still making music
where i begin
now yall know you don't buy no records no more
no tapes, no cds, no record store
got download zones and ringtones
but yo mama and them cant work them cell phones
but the revolution goes on and on
still wide awake at 6 in the morning
had to get it out
to the break of dawn
we still sayin what we sayin
and not playin
