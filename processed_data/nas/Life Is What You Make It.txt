"life is what you make it"
(feat. dmx)
yo ill will, ruff ryders
what what, sraight like that
you a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
a weed head, a coke sniffer
you rich or a broke nigga
know you all relate to this shit that i wrote niggas
lots of my mans trapped up in a max
penatentary, sending me letters i answer back
that eventually, we all be bentley'ed out
throwing campaigns, fuck it i'm running for white house
my niggas control senate, pipe seats jeeps tinted
mad lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
did dirt now i knew it would come back one day
so i'm on point, scrap, prepare for gunplay
stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
ready to blast ,nigga gave me daps said i feel ya
can't believe how my life changed
from the hood, the first time in my life i can say i did the right thing
life is what you make it nigga, i'ma make it
no matter what it takes my nigga, we gonna take it(uh)
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
everyday shit, around the way shit got me stressed (what)
so i keep on the vest in case a nigga wanna  test (uh)
i got no time for games cause i'm all grown up
you wanna joke nigga? laugh when you get blown up (come on)
see how funny it is when your kids aint got no father
cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real)
shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what)
didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on)
life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit
wake up one day, 40 years old on some bumb shit
time flew by, you was too fly to see the light
everyday it's getting darker then comes the night
now what? (what) realize that you ain't got shit (uh)
not long ago you was the man on some hot shit
so just peep the flow yo, cause you already in this
make sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh)
make history before you go
fuck the misery, you po we gettin doe
except the ?dollars? other reasons why i'm living yo (why?)
time is viable
low and behold the young, black, and powerful
got to eat yo, everyday my daughters feet grow
you wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
payin doctors when i'm born, a preacher when i'm buried
that's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
gotta pay just for living, tax life is a b'ness (business)
if you catch a bad deal, watch your life deminish
deals made by god and the devil, and we in it
pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
just strap up and hold on, hope for the best
prepare for the worse, no fears no nothing on earth
no tears if i'm dumped in a hearse, i won't be the first
nor the last nigga, let's get this cash nigga
