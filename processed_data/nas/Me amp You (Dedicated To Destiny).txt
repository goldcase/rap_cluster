"me & you (dedicated to destiny)"
i'd like to dedicate this one here to my star,
to the one i cherish,
she loves me unconditionally - no matter what,
i love her; always be here for you baby
yeah
so for god, who gave me this gift, you;
so i give you this...
(if i had it all...)
bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh
bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh, woooahhh
yeeaah
just me and my little one
just me and my little one
woooah
even though we don't live in the same home,
and i may have missed yo graduation,
and no matter how many miles i’m away from you,
you know i love you,
daddy on every station,
thinkin, i’m lovin my occupation,
i know i got you home waiting,
des-y, i do it all for you
bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh, (daddy’s little girl)
bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh woooahhh (i would give you the world)
little girl i give you the world
yeeaah
just me and my little one
just me and my little one
i give you the world
woooah
even though you’ll be grown soon,
you gotta stand on your own two,
please listen what daddy told you,
i know you think that i’m old school,
you’ll see that i was right soon,
one day you will meet the right groom,
and then,
you will see your life bloom,
and then you’ll know what’s right for you,
bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh, (daddy’s little girl)
bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh woooahhh (i would give you the world)
little girl i give you the world
yeeaah
just me and my little one
just me and my little one
i give you the world
woooah
respect ya mom, no one will replace her,
she’s the one that went thru the labour,
but you don’t owe her no favours,
but her respect is due,
see daddy just wanna show you,
all the heartache i go thru,
for you,
(this world of mine i give it all to you)
bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh, (daddy’s little girl)
bap bap bap bap bap, daa dee aaa deee ahhh woooahhh (i would give you the world)
little girl i give you the world
yeeaah
just me and my little one
just me and my little one
i give you the world
woooah
