"power, paper & pussy" lyrics
nas lyrics
"power, paper & pussy"
ayo i hit the earth like a comet, invasion
nas is like the afrocentric asian
right here with the amazing green lantern
serious radio, y'all know what it is
nas too real, nas true king
you know the king
cars with police radars on highways bopping
ballpen therapy, cell block dodging
pissy stairways, miss them days not
when they shut down the stores when i'm shopping
used to be pop locking train hopping
face covered in stocking
6 pack bud drinking gambler
fuck the camera's in front of the man sing hustla's mantra
the hands of luck
more hits than gamble & huff
or holland & dozier 40 belows cover the toes i was a soldier
with the pop eye sipping the malta
nigga honestly i call this a culture
my sisters a snake
my brothers a vulture
my mothers the block my fathers a ghetto piranha
swimming with sharks my tone is falsetto drama, obama
if the kids mirror you, we'll all push maserati's with the silver u
they fear that connection,
i'd rather die in a box than live safe in witness protection
gotti was a racist but he still get praises
we don't give a fuck, nigga gangsta is gangsta
bricks come with bill clintons name on it, taped up
hollywood lohan parties, people they face numb
kim kardashian, body with the waist slim
know some hood girls who did time could take them
rappers changing families
fags are all lost, i'm at the waldorf
van cleef under the sleeve, save your smalltalk
i feel alive, new porsche's jordan number 5's
already said i'm the last real nigga alive
nas, let my words guide you
from crips to piru this is survival
turn my voice up
let my words guide you
from crips to piru this is survival
invasion!
