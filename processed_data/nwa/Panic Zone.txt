"panic zone"
(feat. egyptian lover)
panic zone, don't get your girl in here
a way out in here, a way out in here
a way out in here, a way out in here
a way out in here, a way out in here
a way out in here, a way out in here
panic zone, don't get your girl in here
panic zone, don't get your girl in here
panic zone, don't get your girl
it's called the panic zone
(the panic zone!) that's right the panic zone
some people call it torture, but it's where we call home
(we are the renegades of this territory, and you're the prey)
i'm the arabian prince (and we're n.w.a.)
don't interfere with the sound you here
cause it's a dangerous groove
i'm in control of your mind and soul
don't be afraid, just bust the moves
so out your home, you're on your own
in the land of the unknown
it's the darkside, the dirty-side
it's called the panic zone
do not attempt to adjust your radio; there is nothing wrong
the underworld is taking control
we're not only in dimension of sight and sound but of mind
there's a sign posted up in here, and it reads the panic zone
now the party is at the peek
co we suggest you move your feet
n.w.a. create the groove, and dr. dre creates the beat
so if you got the juice, and your feeling loose
let the music take your mind
the prince is here, don't interfere
our world is one of a kind
this place is called the west, west-coast of the usa
the panic zone's homebase, in a place we call l.a.
so ladies, all the ladies, if your all alone
just call arabian prince, in the panic zone (pa-pa-panic zone)
a way out in here, a way out in here
a way out in here, a way out in here
a way out in here, a way out in here
a way out in here, a way out in here
