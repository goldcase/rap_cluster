"chin check"
(feat. dr. dre, ice cube, mc ren, snoop dogg)
911, forty reporting
hello 911, help me, help me
what is your emergency
there's someone in my house, there's someone in my house
can you please run by your address for me
151 shenedoah, shenendoah
ma'am where inside the house are you
(oh my god)
ma'am where inside the house are you
in my room, their in my room
ma'am calm down, deputies are on the way
is the door locked
(shriek)

(n n, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a) what the fuck's up dre

i'm a nigga wit an attitude thanks to y'all
and i don't give a fuck i keep it gangsta y'all
i'ma ride for my side in the c.p.t.
god bless the memory of eazy-e
if it wadn't for me where the fuck you'd be?
rappin like the treacherous three, fuckin cowards
i'd have seen dre rockin parties for hours
and i'd have seen ren fuckin bitches from howard
and i'd have seen snoop give away eddie bauer's
so fuck jerry heller and the white superpowers
this the shit niggaz kill for
they hear the villain niggaz spittin' with them nigga flows
fuck you hoes, fuck you bitch ass niggaz too
got something for you broke
these niggaz wearin' skirts like the pope
who them niggaz that you love to get (us)
who them niggaz that you fuckin' wit' (us)
love the girl that weed and shit (what)
the saga continues, with the worlds most dangerous group
four deep in the coup
(im a spill it)
i'ma smoke where i wanna smoke (fuck that)
i'ma choke who i wanna choke (fuck that)
i'ma ride where i wanna ride (fuck that)
cause i'ma nigga 4 life, so i'ma nigga til i diz-ie
(n n, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a)
i'ma smoke where i wanna smoke (fuck that)
i'ma choke who i wanna choke (fuck that)
(n n, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a)
i'ma ride where i wanna ride (fuck that)
cause i'ma nigga 4 life, so i'ma motherfuckin nigga til i diz-ie
a pencil, a pen, or a glock
im the original, subliminal, subterranium
titianium, criminal minded, swift
d-r-e with that fuck a bitch shit (fuck a biatch)
a couple o' notes and get you hog-tied in rope
dope like tons of coke, cutthroat
you don't want the pistols to whistle
candy paint impala
i make hoes pop collars
god damn hoes, here we go again
fuckin with ren, playin' to win
(he got the) coke in hand, (i got the) juice and gin
same shit you was fuckin wit way back then
we keep it crackin' from the actin to the jackin
g'ed up c'ed up motherfucker blaze the weed up
we all on deck fool so put your heat up
i stay on deck so me don't get wet
look my nigga, we can scatter like buckshots
let's get together, make a record, why the fuck not?
why the fuck not?
why the fuck not?
why the fuck not?
cause i'm tight as the night
i had to wipe activator off the mic, in 1985
(n n, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a)
real niggaz, biatch, you know, ha hah
we cause tragedy, erratically
systematically, in your house without a key
how fucked up that'd be
gat'll be near your anatomy, my form of flattery
assault and battery, cus we coming with that street mentality
straight west coast rider academy
concrete nigga, that's my reality
we tend to bus' on niggaz that get mad at me
was it a bitch in the mix
well it had to be
lying tricks told them dicks i had a key
hoes make the world harder than it have to be
(yea thats right)
i'ma smoke where i wanna smoke (fuck that)
i'ma choke who i wanna choke (fuck that)
i'ma ride where i wanna ride (fuck that)
cause i'ma nigga 4 life, so i'ma nigga til i diz-ie
i'ma smoke where i wanna smoke (fuck that)
i'ma choke who i wanna choke (fuck that)
i'ma ride where i wanna ride (fuck that)
cause i'ma nigga 4 life, so i'ma motherfuckin nigga til i diz-ie
n n, dup dup, dup double u, a a, a a
