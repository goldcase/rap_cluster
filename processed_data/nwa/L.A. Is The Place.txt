"l.a. is the place"
(feat. the d.o.c.)
l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a.
l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a.
l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a.
l.a. is the place!
i'm not a renegade but you wish i would
just because i like to hang with boys in the hood
live in l.a. always chill on the west coast
a tilly mogul got it close just i mean to boast
i said what's up, we'll be who riding on you
nick name eazy-e, and i'm down with the crew
you come talking that trash, we'll pull your card
it's not the bronx, it's l.a. but just as hard
don't get me wrong i like to brag on the city i own
the subway r-t-d, don't ride it alone
you might have silly thoughts, that were insane
but the city i'm from, let me explain
in l.a. there things you do not do
first of all, homeboy, don't mess with the crew
you might have silly thoughts that were too soft
but don't play it sweet, or get took off
y'all know the time, it's time to get l
we moved back to l.a. - cal-i-forn-ia
we moved back to l.a. - cal-i-forn-ia
we moved back to l.a. - cal-i-forn-ia
the city of angels.. hollywood.. we love it
i turned you on to the best females in the world
i wish they all could be california girls
like the east where your girls wear too many coats
bring your clothesie, runny noiseie, with a sore throat
that the girls in the south i cannot bust
because the girls are fly and down with us
in the valley not the alley, misdemeanor not ball-ey
eazy-e that's me, always chill in cali'
hollywood's a bit of beef, where the scene is raw
ohh yeah, the strip is a trip on south crenshaw
don't get me wrong i like to brag on the city i own
(boy you walk do what?) don't walk alone
because in l.a. there things you do not do
first of all, homeboy, don't mess with the crew
you might have silly thoughts that were too soft
but don't play it sweet, or get took off
l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a.
l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a. l.a.
l.a. is the place!
build with the brothers who build the old school
get a.. get a.. get a little some of that.. beat box
get get get a little some of that beat box
west coast style from l.a.
yes i gets mine, it's got to be that way
it's sunny california that's where i be
if you forgot homeboy i chill with e
in the west i stand that's where you fall
fila wearing a punk goes snatching it all
rhyme by rhyme record by e
in the city of angels, with a devil like me
she's contaminated where the boys are hard
and people like me don't perpetrate the fraud
you want to mess around, you better get wise
we'll find your butt, and cut you down to size
because in l.a. there things you do not do
first of all, homeboy, don't mess with the crew
you might have silly thoughts that were too soft
but don't play it sweet, or get took off
y'all know the time, it's time to get l
we moved back to l.a. - cal-i-forn-ia
we moved back to l.a. - cal-i-forn-ia
we moved back to l.a. - cal-i-forn-ia
city of angels.. hollywood.. we love it
because in l.a. there things you do not do
first of all, homeboy, don't mess with the crew
you might have silly thoughts that were too soft
but don't play it sweet, or get took off
