"boyz-n-the hood"
(feat. eazy-e)
cruising down the street in my 6-4
jockin the freaks clocking the dough
went to the park to get the scoop
knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
a car pulls up who can it be
a fresh el camino rolled, kilo g
he rolls down his window and he started to say
it's all about making that gta
cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
you come talking that trash we'll pull your card
knowing nothing in life but to be legit
don't quote me boy, cause i ain't saying shit
donald b's in the place to give me the pace
he said my man jb is on freebase
the boy jb was a friend of mine
till i caught him in my car trying to steal my alpine
chased him up the street to call a truce
the silly cluck head pulled out a deuce-deuce
little did he know i had a loaded 12 gauge
one sucker dead, la times first page
bored as hell and i wanna get i'll
so i went to a place where my homeboys chill
the fellows out there, making that dollar
i pulled up in my 6-4 impala
they greet me with a 40 and i started drinking
and from the 8-ball my breath start stinking
love to get my girl, to rock that body
before i left i hit the bacardi
went to her house to get her out of the pad
dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad
she said somethin that i couldn't believe
so i grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
she started talkin shit, wouldn't you know?
reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
her father jumped out and he started to shout
so i threw a right-cross cold knocked him out
i'm rollin hard now i'm under control
then wrapped my 6-4 round the telephone poll
i looked at my car and i said, "oh brother
i throw it in the gutter and go buy another"
walkin home i see the g ride
now kat is drivin kilo on the side
as they busted a u, they got pulled over
an undercover cop in a dark green nova
kat got beaten for resistin arrest
he socked the pig in the head for rippin his guess
now g is caught for doin the crime
fourth offence on the boy, he'll do some time
i went to get them out but there was no bail
the fellaz start to riot in the county jail
two days later in municiple court
kilo g on trial cold cut a fart
disruption of a court, said the judge
on a six-year sentence my man didn't budge
bailiff came over to turn him in
kilo g looked up and gave a grin
he yelled out "fire! " then came suzy
the bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi
police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
both up state for attempted murder
