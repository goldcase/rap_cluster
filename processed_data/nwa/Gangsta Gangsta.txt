"gangsta gangsta"
here's a little somethin' bout a nigga like me
never shoulda been let out the penititary
ice cube would like ta say
that i'm a crazy mutha fucka from around the way
since i was a youth, i smoked weed out
now i'm the mutha fucka that ya read about
takin' a life or two
that's what the hell i do, you don't like how i'm livin
well fuck you!
this is a gang, and i'm in it
my man dre'll fuck you up in a minute
with a right left, right left you're toothless
and then you say goddamn they ruthless!
everwhere we go they say
n w a's fuckin' up tha program
and then you realize we don't care
we don't just say no, we to busy sayin' yeah!
to drinkin' straight out the eight bottle
do i look like a mutha fuckin role model?
to a kid lookin' up ta me
life ain't nothin but bitches and money.
cause i'm tha type o' nigga that's built ta last
if ya fuck wit me i'll put a foot in ya ass
see i don't give a fuck 'cause i keep bailin
yo, what the fuck are they yellin
gangsta, gangsta!  that's what they're yellin
"it's not about a salary, it's all about reality"
gangsta, gangsta!  that's what they're yellin
"hopin you sophisticated motherfuckers hear what i have to say"
when me and my posse stepped in the house
all the punk-ass niggaz start breakin out
cause you know, they know whassup
so we started lookin for the bitches with the big butts
like her, but she keep cryin
"i got a boyfriend" bitch stop lyin
dumb-ass hooker ain't nuttin but a dyke
suddenly i see, some niggaz that i don't like
walked over to em, and said, "whassup?"
the first nigga that i saw, hit em in the jaw
ren started stompin em, and so did e
by that time got rushed by security
out the door, but we don't quit
ren said, "let's start some shit!"
i got a shotgun, and here's the plot
takin niggaz out with a flurry of buckshots
boom boom boom, yeah i was gunnin
and then you look, all you see is niggaz runnin
and fallin and yellin and pushin and screamin
and cussin, i stepped back, and i kept bustin
and then i realized it's time for me to go
so i stopped, jumped in the vehicle
it's like this, because of that who-ride
n.w.a. is wanted for a homicide
cause i'm the type of nigga that's built to last
fuck wit me, i'll put my foot in your ass
see i don't give a fuck, cause i keep bailin
yo, what the fuck are they yellin?
gangsta, gangsta!  that's what they're yellin
"it's not about a salary, it's all about reality"
gangsta, gangsta!  that's what they're yellin
"he'll tell you exactly how he feel, and don't want a fuckin thing back"
homies all standin around, just hangin
some dope-dealin, some gang-bangin
we decide to roll and we deep
see a nigga on dayton's and we creep
real slow, and before you know
i had my shotgun pointed in the window
he got scared, and hit the gas
right then, i knew i has to smoke his ass
he kept rollin, i jumped in the bucket
we couldn't catch him, so i said fuck it
then we headed right back to the fort
sweatin all the bitches in the biker shorts
we didn't get no play, from the ladies
with six niggaz in a car are you crazy?
she was scared, and it was showin
we all said "fuck you bitch!" and kept goin
to the hood, and we was fin to
find somethin else to get into
like some pussy, or in fact
a bum rush, but we call it rat pack
on a nigga for nuttin at all
ice cube'll go stupid when i'm full of eight ball
i might stumble, but i won't lose
now i'm dressed in the county blues
cause i'm the type of nigga that's built to last
if you fuck wit me, i'll put my foot in your ass
i don't give a fuck, cause i keep bailin
yo, what the fuck are they yellin?
(wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit)
{man whatcha gonna do now?}
"what we're gonna do right here is go way back"
(how far you goin back?)
"way back"
"as we go a lil somethin like this"
here's a lil gangsta, short in size
a t-shirt and levi's is his only disguise
built like a tank yet hard to hit
ice cube and eazy e cold runnin shit
well i'm eazy e the one they're talkin about
nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
police tried to roll, so it's time to go
i creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
wit the "diamond in the back, sun-roof top"
diggin the scene with the gangsta lean
cause i'm the e, i don't slang or bang
i just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang
and all you bitches, you know i'm talkin to you
"we want to fuck you eazy!" i want to fuck you too
cause you see, i don't really take no shit
cause i'm the type of nigga that's built to last
if you fuck wit me, i'll put my foot in your ass
i don't give a fuck, cause i keep bailin
yo, what the fuck are they yellin?
gangsta, gangsta!  that's what they're yellin
"it's not about a salary, it's all about reality"
gangsta, gangsta!  that's what they're yellin
"he'll fuck up you and yours, and anything that gets in his way"
gangsta, gangsta!  that's what they're yellin
"it's not about a salary, it's all about reality"
gangsta, gangsta!  that's what they're yellin
"he'll just call you a low-life motherfucker, and talk about your
funky ways"
