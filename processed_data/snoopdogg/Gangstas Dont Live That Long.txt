snoop dogg lyrics
"gangstas don't live that long"
alright i'm ready
rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'...
for life, for life...
(i like that)
gangsta shit
(we gon')
real smooth, you dig?
the big boss dogg
snoop d-o-double-g
(see you niggas on )
cause my life's worth more than
the money that ya' live and die for
and where i'm from my nigga you get shot
for sellin' out your man when he the reason you got on
(i ain't trippin')
you know they say, that gangsters don't live that long
but how can i be here homes if i wasn't real-ly that strong
i pro'ly should be long gone
tell me (tell me, tell me, tell me)
tell me, what does it take to be dangerous
everytime i look around, the game steady changin'
from coast to coast, rearranging
them boys out west, we insist to keep it bangin' (westside)
ah yeah, we maintaining, burnin' up the charts, we spark, now we blazin'
my young home boy, he amazing
the cookie, rookie, shook him and took him
and now he famous (wow)
couldn't quite picture that, wonder what he fishin' at
now ya talkin' bout this and that
but pass that loc, i don't diss no mo'
i make number one hits, you know
believe me, i make it look easy
you wanna know how to do it, then watch snoop deezie
yeah, cuz, the game won't wait up
dismissed all the beef and shook all the haters
and took on the new routine
started coaching youth football to go straight clean
like mean joe green, i step on the scene
they want an autograph and a picture, you know what i mean? (nah mean?)
i get to 'em, nigga, don't ask why
i'm real to my people, that's just how i ride
yeah, since i slid in the do', i been at this
some gangsta mack shit, but i did it with practice
yeah, yeah, y'all know i get actin'
i live to learn, teach to reach my status
top of the charts, have heart, have money
to have money, you gotta have heart
it's been thirteen years, no pain, no tears
respected by all my peers
no matter where i'm posted at, my hands stay close to that
ratta da dat dada dadat dadat
and as a matter of fact, no beef on the streets
no black on black. we gon' be all on one track
so i fall in ride or get lost in the pack
it's like that, fo' real, we ain't bluffin'
right now it's west coast or nothin'
i'll push that line and in due time
y'all gon' respect this cause out here, fool, we rhyme
oh, yeah, we bang, but right now it ain't time
so put away yo' nine, an' fall in line
(tell 'em why)
