"superman"
(feat. willie nelson, mickey raphael)
you know snoopy a little while back
i had one of those, carpal tunnel operations
and the doctor said "i want you to go home and
shut up (mm) for four months," annnd that's kinda tough
i said "i'll try it," but while i was there
i wrote this song
too many pain pills, too much pot
tryin to be somethin that i'm not - superman! superman
tryin to do more than i can, i got a little outta hand
i ain't superman - know what i'm talkin 'bout?
i blew my throat and i blew my tour
i wound up sippin on soup d'jour - i wasn't superman
oh no, i wasn't superman
i'm tryin to do more than i can, i got a little outta hand
i wasn't superman
i hear ya! mickey play with us
...
yeah, play that mickey, go ahead!
play it willie!
yeah... go ahead willie
well the doctor said son it's a cryin shame
but you ain't clark kent and i ain't lois lane
you ain't superman; you ain't superman
tryin to do more than you can, you got a little outta hand
you ain't superman - whaddya think snoop?
well when i die, put it on my stone
god said snoop you take your bad ass home you wasn't superman
ha ha ha, no, i wasn't superman
i'm tryin to do more than i can, i got a little outta hand
i wasn't superman (i hear ya!)
tryin to do more than i can, i got a little outta hand
i ain't superman
yeahhh!
