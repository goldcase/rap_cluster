"promise i"
promise i never leave you...
boy boy boy

you got me in a daze
and i dont know if it's the haze

hang out with the d-o-double
girl be apart of this
now hang up your coat

you ever seen a stretch li jet two seater (no)
it aint what you want it's what you need
a real ass nigga to help you kick your feet up (yea)
now flip your channel to lifetime
you stay on my mind even when i'm writing rhymes
we can chill all day until the nightime
i'll let you know when to go at the right time
i know you don't want to go
but you got to get the hell up outta here
i say go, you say no, go
have a drink have a toast

and we dont wait until the first of the month
we never hesitate to roll a hundred dolla blunt
nigga money it's nothing to us
it's big pimpin over here baby you fuckin wit us
struck it rich with the struck of the luck of the dutch
tripled you up you alittle late for the flush
you got plans for a honeymoon
i got plans to move your fine ass up in my living room
at the studio on the d-low is you wit it
you gots to stay committed
to do what i say no matter how i spit it, you wit it
if i say go, that means go
