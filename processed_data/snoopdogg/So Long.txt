"so long"
(feat. angela hunte)
so long we’ve been on this journey
and i know we can make it
stay strong our hearts been yearning
and no one can break it
round and round our road keeps turning
no one can stop the time
it’s just another bridge we’re crossing
keep this message in your souls and minds
they try to break a bond
but what they didn’t know
that we were built so strong
ye they didn’t know
but in their hearts and minds
we were gone
said we were an old show
baby don’t you cry
for as long as i’m alive, you live
so long we’ve been on this journey
and i know we can make it
stay strong our hearts been yearning
and no one can break it
round and round our road keeps turning
no one can stop the time
it’s just another bridge we’re crossing
keep this message in your souls and minds
if i should die tonight
i’d be happy that i knew you
if i should lose my sight
it’s still know all with all my mind
if all the words and fights
still can’t get it right
baby don’t you cry
for as long as i’m alive, you live
so long we’ve been on this journey
and i know we can make it
stay strong our hearts been yearning
and no one can break it
round and round our road keeps turning
no one can stop the time
it’s just another bridge we’re crossing
keep this message in your souls and minds
