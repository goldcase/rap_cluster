"boss' life"
(feat. akon)
some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
some of 'em lie about the guns they pop
but i don't, i don't, i don't, i don't
that's how it is for me 'cause i live a boss' life
so many niggaz wanna play but still got dues to pay
some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
but i don't, i don't, i don't, i don't
that's how it is for me 'cause i live a boss' life
now this is for the b's and the c's, and the d's and the h's
and the g's puttin work in overseas
at ease with the doggy and smoke some weed
fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
baby this is presidential really
a pocket full of women understanding how i'm living
show them hoes how you winning
it's the beginning with the pearls you're given
the world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
but everyday like 50 say, it's +many men+
they wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
but separate the paper and the benz and the cribs
then the hoes, then the clothes, i'ma have to let 'em go
you know how the dogg roll.. don't get it twisted
'cause he bang out the east just in case you wanna visit
a touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin pimpish
and it's comin from the beach where them niggaz is a beast
but i just listen, all that shit is in my past
i'm connected to the purse first nigga.. the ass last
from long beach to venice is the premise
want the green like spinach and i'm strong to the finish
see me man, i'm nothin like you
i got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
i'm leanin in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin
me, i'm ridin by ya on the corner, block slangin
i'm livin that boss' life (life)
the hoes come runnin when they see me comin
i'm livin that boss' life (life)
you can have anything just don't fuck with my money (my money)
this is for the west and the east and the dirty south
khaki's and them tim's and them niggaz with the platinum mouths
thinkin that they blessed by the actions that be comin out
when you in magic city you be carrying a lot of clout
but trickin ain't the route (route), that's even if you got it
there's a method to you holdin it when they can't do without it
just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it
you can have her and her partner, fuckin with it for a dolla
if she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller
roll with the bo$$ dogg in the back of a blue impala
and if she follow.. then she gon' swallow
all the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
but i would never bother breakin out (tha doggfather)
'less i knew that she was 'bout him, havin diamonds on his collar
i'm just an author, spreading game to my partners
walkin on the blue carpet with the doctor (doctor)
