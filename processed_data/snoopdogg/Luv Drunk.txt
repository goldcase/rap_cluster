and i got that fire luvin', the more you need the more
oooh lemme say oooohooh aaahaaaah

pull your lunchbreak lemme hit it real quick
back to your job before they know what is

i dont know what it is but i luv what i did
huggin and touchin' and all that shit
drink to your drunk, see my luv is a fill
yea this for you boo it's a gift
everytime i'm with her, i get her hooo, i get her hoo, luv drunk
everytime she's with, she in me, luv drunk
she make me say good luv that's what she's feelin' for..
and i got that fire luvin', the more you need the more
oooh lemme say oooohooh aaahaaaah
everytime she's with me, me i'm dizzy
