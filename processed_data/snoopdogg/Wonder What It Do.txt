"wonder what it do"
(feat. uncle chucc)
i wonder wonder wonder what it do
i wonder wonder wonder what it do
i wonder wonder wonder what it do
i wonder wonder wonder what it do
they say it's? '64 on vogue's
in the game pain still the same they knocking at your door
ooo you wanna only talk bad
it's a sad sad thing you dirty low down
ooo
i wonder wonder wonder what it do
ooo
i wonder wonder wonder what it do
wa la la la la la la la la la
tell me now!
wa la la la la la la la la la
wa la la la la la la la la la
won't you tell me now!
wa la la la la la la la la la
snoop dogg
independent i'm in it been getting my cash right
walking through the day time holding my flashlight
spliff-ted high as i can ever be
i'm lofted drifting on the memory
my style my tone my delivery
my maze is frankie beverly
heavily influenced i do it like you can't
i'm the weed to the zag with the bag and a drink
get live that's five on the black hand side
now try to stay fly with a piece of pie
i heard fish don't burn in the kitchen
the baby gangstas they get in the hood and on a mission
you pump em up they fuck it up
now what you need to do is toughen up
now thug it up what it do dog
i thought you wanted to be like big
snoop dogg
ooo
i wonder wonder wonder what it do
ooo
i wonder wonder wonder what it do
when i get lost
i feel like a boss
she will be my salvation
when i feel lost
with nowhere to go
she'll be my inspiration
she never spends
time with her friends
tells me she's mute without me
and when things go wrong
her faith is strong
i know that she'll never doubt me
hey snoop dogg
ooo
i wonder wonder wonder what it do
ooo
i wonder wonder wonder what it do
wa la la la la la la la la la
tell me now!
wa la la la la la la la la la
wa la la la la la la la la la
won't you tell me now!
wa la la la la la la la la la
