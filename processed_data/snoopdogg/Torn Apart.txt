"torn apart"
(feat. rita ora)
i heard him speak but then a saw his face
i knew we was the one because i dreamt this day
i was such a beginner on this thing called love
and now he's going away and now i'm torn apart, so torn apart
you're one of them, you see me swear
you pullin' triggers let you slide another day
say goodbye to the one that got away
her lips for the very first thing that i saw
she threw like an angel and that made want some more
my reputation says i'm there from now
and now she's going away and now i'm so torn apart, so torn apart
you're one of them, you see me swear
you pullin' triggers let you slide another day
say goodbye to the one that got away
never let you give up
but i should've let you got away
got away, got to find another way
never let 'em get away
gotta find a way to stay
never let 'em get away
never let 'em get away
you never let her go
you never let her go
you see me?
you hear me?
ye
you're one of them, you see me swear
you pullin' triggers let you slide another day
say goodbye to the one that got away
