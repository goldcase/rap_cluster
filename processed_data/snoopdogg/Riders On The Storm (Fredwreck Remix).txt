(feat. the doors)
hey yo jim man

but tell your story, man
you know the one i like
say it for me (ride, ride, ride)
riders on the storm (ride, ride, ride)
riders on the storm (ride, ride, ride)
into this house we're born (into this house we're born)
into this world we're thrown (into this world we're thrown)
like a dog without a bone (like a dog without a bone)
an actor out on loan(an actor out alone)
riders on the storm (ride, ride, ride)
there's a killer on the road (killer, murder)
his brain is squirmin' like a toad
take a long holiday (holidays, holidays)
let your children play (play)
if ya give this man a ride
sweet family will die (die)
killer on the road, yeah (killer, murder)
goin' off of this roll off of that with the lizard king
bumpin' in the back (wow) how bout that (yeah)
driftin', liftin', swiftin', coastin', testaroastin'
but the wheels won't stop 200 (errrr) on the highway fresh
up off the block he's a rider, na he's a killer dresses in all black
but his hat says stella (stella)
pedal to the metal i gotta go hard
drive by and say hello hey fredwreck you my mello now let me

gas cause i just to clean i do it upper class so fasten your seat
belts it's so hot it will even make heat melt (woo, woo) so get a bowl
and roll and ride slip through the slip and slide
like a dog without a bone
an actor out on loan
riders on the storm
there's a killer on the road
his brain is squirmin' like a toad
take a long holiday
let your children play
if ya give this man a ride
sweet family will die
killer on the road, yeah

before you run into the trees (watch out, watch out) i've seen things that
i would have never saw before hey yo jim let'em in, let'em in open up
my back tire smokin' (errrr) the whole street and now the police wanna
flash there lights and chase the dogg all night (woof) but i won't pull over
nor give up, 'cause i just don't give a fuck (what, what, what)

keep the light on east side on snoop dogg and the doors
and yeah we bout to ride on
