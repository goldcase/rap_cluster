"i get lifted"
(with wiz khalifa)
i'm just soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees
smoking on this weed, this is all i need
smoking on this weed, this is all i need
smoking on this weed, this is all i need
i get lifted, i get lifted, everyday
i get lifted, i get lifted, i get lifted, i get lifted, everyday
i get lifted, i get lifted, hey
overzel me, propel me, propeller, cat pilla,
rap healer, dope dealer, grip it back
look it back now, reseller,
exhale, inhaler, feller, juicys pored
dueces for all you loud mouth bitches who adore
i can't play on your field anymore
take it flight, now look at me soar
in and out of space with my foot to the floor
higher and higher, i won't retire
halfie don kaya, love smokin fire tata like satellite,
all on the wire,
keep it up, speed it up, slow it up
throw it up
your bitch is looking at me cause she probably wanna go with us
it's cool with me, hop in, hop in, ain't no stopping
we keep knocking, rocking
i'm just soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees
smoking on this weed, this is all i need
smoking on this weed, this is all i need
smoking on this weed, this is all i need
i get lifted, i get lifted, everyday
i get lifted, i get lifted, i get lifted, i get lifted, everyday
i get lifted, i get lifted, hey
dimes, dubs, quarter ounce oz, put it in a zag
let it burn slowly everywhere i am
nigga got a blow tree rolling every gram
they be like holy smokes, that man no joke
can tell if it's that "mehh" (crap) if you don't choke
never gonna quit, every chance i'm a toke
zips smelling like the whole plants in my coat
for autographs, coming at me with all the names
and what i gotta have
i got my own shit, and this ain't for the little kid
this grown shit, having a party at my crib
bring your own bitch, i got 3, so matter of fact you can take one
and roll a joint baby girl let's bake one
and take this weed and i can show you how to make one, ah
i'm just soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees
niggas know i get lifted it's high school, i stay high, i mean i don't gotta get high i'm already there, yeah, i was high when i said that, haha, whatup snoop!
smoking on this weed, this is all i need
smoking on this weed, this is all i need
smoking on this weed, this is all i need
i get lifted, i get lifted, everyday
i get lifted, i get lifted, i get lifted, i get lifted, everyday
i get lifted, i get lifted, hey
i'm just soaking up the breeze, smoking on some trees
i blame it on you, you blame it on me, we blame it on trees
smoking on this weed, this is all i need
i blame it on you, you blame it on me, we blame it on trees
i get lifted, i get lifted, everyday
i get lifted, i get lifted, i get lifted, i get lifted, everyday
i get lifted, i get lifted, hey
