"been around tha world"
yeah, this record's for my baby, my baby boo
i know i'm always on the road, i'm always gone
and you say i'll never make records for you no more
well this record is from me to you baby
yeah, real talk
been around tha world
i've been into many places seen some unfamiliar faces
but baby none of them compares to you
soon as i get home i'm racing to unplug my phone
i seen everything twice
been around tha world, i've seen every scene twice
stopping down in tokyo, dipping in the rice
i'm a boss at the wind, i cracked every colored dice
i do it big, fuck the rumors
rich and infamous with the blue and gray pumas
gangstas don't die, they just move to miami
i did all that, i was voted ...
i'm sorta like sammy
smoother than marvin, i need me a tammy
sipping chardinae, making deals on my hands free
fatherhood, now the actors can't stand me
'cause i own rap and i'm coming for your day job
until then i'm chilling at the day spa
relax my mind and just chill
'cause without you none of this is real
baby you know i
been around tha world
i've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
but baby none of them compares to you
soon as i get home i'm racing to unplug my phone
yeah, but now i'm back across the water
i'm in sydney with somebody's daughter
blowing sticky by the zips and they can tell
by my rag hanging, fuck this is crip, but i'm chilling
it feels so good to get away
especially when your name is d o double gizzee
coast to coast jetting, man i been doing that
what's up, just start balling ... i been around the track
hop in peas with the bosses
300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office
docking down in monaco, churching with my folks
bad luck had me dying when i fell up out that boat
my life is like a movie
but the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me
then i relax and chill
'cause without you none of this is real
baby you know i
been around tha world
i've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
but baby none of them compares to you
soon as i get home i'm racing to unplug my phone
been around tha world
i've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
but baby none of them compares to you
soon as i get home i'm racing to unplug my phone
just for you baby
yeah, i'm on my way home right now
i'm on my way right now
i'm leaving the studio right now
yeah, soon as i get home tomorrow i'ma go unplug it
matter of fact i ain't even gonna bring it in the house
see you in a minute
