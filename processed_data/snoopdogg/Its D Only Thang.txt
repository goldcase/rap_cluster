"it's d only thang"
winners, everybody wants to be a winner
winning is everything uh, nah, winning it’s the only thing
winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang
when you’re living life in the game
winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang
when you’re living life in the game,
winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang
when you’re living life in the game,
winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang
when you’re living life in the game,
i can jump out the jet, i can run, i can swim
i am heavy on the case, i stay in first place
mud on my shoes, taste blood on my face
out of town, touch down never out of bounds
i train for the gold, i can go twelve rounds
steal city baby, we are super bowl bound
recollect a stack while i check a checker flag
all this winning got me grinning
all this losing got you mad
no more chuck t’s on my feet, it’s just adidas
man they kept it true to the streets
and like he c, i’m on a 50 game win streak
i can’t be beat, i am the real heat
real king real rings, that’s what we say
i threw a shirt out and cut out i’m on my way
pga car under he may play?
it’s what amazing happens in the nba, eh
eo, we don’t take them on the west side
yeah, i was born to be the best right
rest and sleep is for the weak
the last shot y’all can go and put it on me
the last swing, the last throw, double u is all a dog know
w-i-n, w-e-s-t og, snoop d-o double g
winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang
when you’re living life in the game
winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang
when you’re living life in the game,
winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang
when you’re living life in the game,
winning ain’t everything, winning it’s d only thang
when you’re living life in the game,
no matter what game it is, winning it ain’t everything, it’s the only thang
and make sure you go hard, blood sweat and tears
shout out to all the winners out there
that’s all i do is win, ya digg? it ain’t easy
congratulations, winner.
