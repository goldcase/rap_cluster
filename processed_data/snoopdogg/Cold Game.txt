"cold game"
(feat. latoiya williams)
i had seen a lot of niggers come up in this game
but never did they make the look so good
from candy cars to bright yellow bras
the gangster white walls and the wood
you see, there comes a time in a man's life
where you gotta choose the goods of the game
oh, but it so hard to turn your back on a place
where everybody knows your name
it's a cold game, i ain't been one to
jump in and out of the range
maybe an old school synagogue
spinnin' the vision from which i faint
you got to do it, you can, gotta keep rhymin'
east side high enjoyin' life, hair blowin' in the wind
the state that i'm in is gangster bliss
this is what you're callin' a sis
passin' them off quick, memories missed
i made a lot of friends, a whole lot of money
been down a couple times, but it never stopped my rhymin'
in fact, i got better, clutchin' on beretta's
blowin' a sticky, turn it to whether
a war shows in dough free lobos, this is how a player roll
and i never be questioned by some new young chump
poppin' their toss, snoopy d.o. made the way for you to walk
owe it to the almighty, without you it couldn't be done
your praise put the rise of the son, you dig?
hold closer my hands from my throne
and i never be crucified within my own zone
here is a very good reason to show love
but you gotta separate grown man from grown thug
from mamas goin' down for murder in '93
to keys all over the city bowlin' in snoops league
i changed, i got smarter, i got a daughter
two sons, beautiful wife for starters
i did it all, jack, poppin' this peas
eatin' international cuisine overseas, yeah
don't judge me, you only knew snoopy
you never tried to know calvin, you tried to groove me up
like some loco, i earned my respect
did so much shit for the coast, i should get a check
but all in all, i did it, b, cool as a blind with a c
leveled my life as i push away the groupies
snoopin' in a coopin', you can call me uncle snoopy
don't worry about your circumstances
take your chances, still from the b, l, b, c
for you are the c
haler at you're the snoopy
haler at you're the snoopy
i paid my dues
and now it's time to make a change
gotta make that move
there's a time and place for everythin'
i paid my dues
and now it's time to make a change
gotta make that move
there's a time and place for everythin'
i paid my dues
and now it's time to make a change
gotta make that move
there's a time and place for everythin'
i paid my dues
and now it's time to make a change
gotta make that move
there's a time and place for everythin'
don't worry about your circumstances
take your chances, still from the l b c
for you are the c
haler at you're the snoopy
haler at you're the snoopy
