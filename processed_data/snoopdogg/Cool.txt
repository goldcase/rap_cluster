"cool"
i got a penthouse in manhattan
two more in malibu
i bought an 87 cadillac seville
i got a maserati too
i wear diamonds on my fingers
a couple on my toes,
i wear the finest cologne money can buy
it keeps me smellin’ like a rose
if u wonderin’ how i do it
there’s just one simple rule...i’m just cool (cool)
honey baby cant you see...i’m just cool (cool)
aint nobody bad like me
what’s that spell? (c-o-o-l)
what’s the spell? (c-o-o-l)
i might dine in san francisco
dance all night in rome
i go any freakin’ place i want to
and my lear jet brings me home
i got ladies by the dozen
i got money by the ton
just aint nobody better
heaven knows that i’m the one
its all because of something
that i didn’t learn in school,
im just cool (cool)
honey baby cant you see...i’m soo cool (cool)
aint nobody bad like me
what’s that spell? (c-o-o-l)
what’s that spell? (c-o-o-l)
and im cool im just cool (cool,cool,cool)
im just cool im just cool cool cool
when i look into the mirror
theres just something i already know
im just cool(cool)
honey baby cant you see...i’m just cool (cool)
aint nobody bad like me
spell it (c-o-o-l)
whats that spell? (c-o-o-l) cool
sing it baby cool
whats that spell? (cool)
