"i believe in you"
(feat. latoiya williams)
i'm so glad that you believe in me like i believe in you
this love's exactly how i picture... (how i picture)
it's such a joy when i receive all that i need in you
we're flowing smooth just like a river... (like a river)
express my true
when, i make love to you... (to you)
just like that day back in september
if we might run in some problems
i know you'll see me through
there's nothing for you i wont do
cause i believe in you... (you)
oh i believe in you... (you)
and i believe in you too
see can't nobody make me do what you do
i mean i'm so in love with you... (boo)
i never thought a girl could make me
take me
to a whole new world
re-shape me, love me, hate me
lately
we ain't been fussing or fighting
you play all day and i be working at night and
the only one who understands my life and
the cake and the icing
these other girls
in the world
live their life so trifling
i couldn't do it no more
i had to sit you down
and make you my wife and... (yaa)
cold thing
but you know
it's a cold gain... (goal gain)
it's so real
i had to bless you with my last name... (last name)
slowed me down
straight took me out the fast lane... (fast lane)
hold me down
come on baby
watch me do this thing... (do it)
i been crowned king
so i guess that means you're my queen
you have my seeds
lets go ahead and raise this team
it's so special
you're all i ever need
i'm feeling good and my baby's home
you're spending time
holding hands
to this beat
the fellow that can satisfy my every need
is he the one?
we've been around and we're both grown... (grown)
look at me... (me)
i'm like a baby
i took that chance
and i feel secure about this love romance
let's have some fun
and i believe when you say
ain't that special... (oh)
touch my soul... (soul)
feel the same
when you whisper softly
and call my name
here i come
it's more than words that i ever could sing
you're that chill bring
maybe your walk or just the way you do me
i really think we are the two
cause i believe in you
take a second realize we can make it if you
don't stop
come on boy we about to take it
to the top
i know you're gonna love what you're about to see
do you believe in me?
we can make it all nite long
baby if we
don't stop
come on boy you know you got me
so hot
i know i'm gonna love what you're about to do
cause i believe in you
i believe in you
and i believe in you too
cause its the right thing to do
and i believe in you too
cause its the only thing to do
i couldn't give you away
no matter what my friends sizzay
see when i'm gone
away from home
i'm alone every dizzay
i left a gang of messages for you
on your two way
but you ain't hollered back
but you know how, you play
you say, ok
i say, no way
we got to be together forever
and a dizzay
cause i believe in you
take a second realize we can make it if we
don't stop
come on boy we about to take it
to the top

don't stop
come on boy you know you got me
so hot
i know i'm gone love what you're about to do
cause i believe in you
