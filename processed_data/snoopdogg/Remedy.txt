snoop dogg lyrics
"remedy"
(feat. busta rhymes and chris brown)
when it's over now
nothing left for the enemy
when the show goes down
and you silence the melody
(that's when you say)
i'll be that some boy in miami
rude boy you in the kingston
bad boy in new england
new york the whole kingdom
i ain't got the remedy
but when they root for me
you see i'm what they see
i'm living in the sin it's how it's gonna be
i heard the boy is sinnin and they die for me
wadadadang wadadadadang
well you coming on the dance
and now we shaped up our game
wadadadang wadadadadang
and you know we never ever stop
beat them to the end
see them on top on them
willin them, killing them
and then one after
see it
run to it when nobody asked to be drop off
when we on my bred snoop lion
meets his blessing love and honor
to what we are apart
and to what we are even
you know say it all we all prosper
news flash pick a little ash
every website and blog
snoop and busta in the studio
hanging out here, get a little bit of snap on
don't ever get it twisted
see we gifted when togheter
reincarnated snoop lion so let's see out forever
i ain't got the remedy
but when they root for me
you see i'm what they see
i'm living in the sin it's how it's gonna be
i heard the boy is sinnin and they die for me
somebody help me wake up
and make it rain on my head
let it rain, let it rain, let it rain on my head
set it free, so complete, everything has come to ending
let it breathe
when the background clears
and you're the one standing there
you're running out of time
you're praying that you make a hit
whatever they do, whatever they do to you
whatever they say, whatever they say to you too bad
sound off in that paris
roll call in lebanon
many leros in mexico
can you hear me, the whole kingdom
i ain't got the remedy
but when they root for me
you see i'm what they see
i'm living in the sin it's how it's gonna be
i heard the boy is sinnin and they die for me
somebody help me wake up
and make it rain on my head
let it rain, let it rain, let it rain on my head
set it free, so complete, everything has come to ending
let it breathe
