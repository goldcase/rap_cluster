"6:30"
(with wiz khalifa)
fuck (fuck fuck...)
you know a nigga really don't wanna go to school today
lemme call this bitch
get my shit together
when i pull up people so fresh in my ride
we smoke the best you can buy
them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
keep stunting just cause i can
these hoes know just who i am
them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
this one's for the g's all black chuck's on the cuffs of my jeans
king size papes full of trees, i be with the boss dog(g) ya'll fuck niggas please
now they say i'm hot, hundred somethin' degrees
taking pictures with a young nigga cheese
remember days homey, i ain't had a thing
now i'm hoping off the plane putting roaches on the wing
and my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings
jewelry froze, like fling
money come fast, yours slow like lean
rolling up grass, so weed to have the stash, so i know i'm gonna fast
third period, showing up last
with a late note blowin' green smoke
we blow to the middle of the day
wiz say dawg put the middle of the jay
hey, why not? not why?
we fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high
fuck it, everybody to the library
got a new batch, some blue - booberry
stuck in the hallway, with a pass say dawg he just smoke all day
it's a mind game like the ream i seem to keep migraines
i'm so lifted, like a parachuter
my grass day off day off ferris bueller
slip away, dip away, almost had to throw a zip away
but fuck that, this taylor gang, what you want dog
shit i'm on everythang
you niggas never had and you never will
you niggas never had and you never will
i said you niggas never had and you never will
big snoop and wiz smoke with the kill (kill kill)
you niggers still in high-school, elementary ass niggas
holla at me when you graduate
we be posted right by the 400 building
room 420
follow your nose, your no-nose (ha-ha)
niggas ain't hard like us
niggas soft as doctors cock swab
you bitchin'
smoke somethin'
