(with erick sermon, method man)
(feat. rl)

huh! ball! i get the game from my pop
'til everyone know my name the game don't stop

until i'm big as rihanna and mason's rock
while you love sosa

open your eyes let your window down now you in the passenger side

waan come test me now tell 'em the lion did it
and bit 'em off a chip of the block of the wood
lil' homie couldn't rock if he could click cockin and pull
hip hopin over lot of the bull more pull

hey! hey! nigga look real quick!

yo! like a room full of black of raw heat
they see the flow back gettin all geek, it's like i'm pete charles i'm all street
they come in time money but talk cheap
but rappers wanna kick it i'm all feet
every line artistic that's all me, my man's son autistic that's so key
the why go and get it i'm so g
that's why i wear the fitted so low key, that's why i kill the critic for no fee
then tell the judge i did it and go free
e double e my co-d
let's throw the book at 'em what's yo' plea?
guilty as charged that's how it is when your guilty and charged
took a bunch of def, artist and built me a squad
what's today's math? build with the god, weed, women and cars
lock the game down i'm givin 'em bars
what is life if you ain't livin it large? if you ain't livin it large
go get the price checked and get you a job
but wait
hey! hey! let me explain this
hey! hey! let me explain this
hey! hey! (say it with your chest!)
(lil' ass nigga! say it with your chest!)
hey! hey! nigga look real quick!
hey! hey! nigga look real quick!
hey! hey! nigga look real quick!
hey! hey! nigga look real quick!
yeah!
