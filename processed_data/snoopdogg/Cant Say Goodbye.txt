"can't say goodbye"
(feat. charlie wilson, the gap band)
i'm a man i gotta take care of my family
fighting these precious in my life
i know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
but these streets won't say a goodbye
i can't say goodbye
to the blocks
goodbye
to the hood
goodbye
to the streets (to my problems)
i can't say goodbye
to the hood
goodbye
to the blocks
goodbye
to the streets
i can't say goodbye goodbye
to the blocks
goodbye
to the streets
goodbye
to the hood
i can't say goodbye
to the hood
goodbye
to the blocks
goodbye
to the homies
i guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy
plus, my hood just lost another homeboy
another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy
they in the street tell me "just leave it alone boy,
let them do them take care of your own boy"
but i said back brake a bound, before i was drome boy
you had dreams of being a dope boy
yeah, i was runnin' from the po po
banging for the truth, late night huntin'
puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt,
pay day, get the spot, got my hair cut first
made mom sick when i wouldn't go to church
yeah i live in the burbs, but i think 21st
i know since i left that it's gotten much worse
but i'd still be there, if i couldn't write a verse
to the the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made
me, tough enough to hang on the corners that would moul me
critics wonder if i'm tryna be the old me,
but if the thing the old me ever left, then they don't really know me,
and don't know, we don't change, we just become og, you always addicted
to the life, you just don't od, i owe the streets before they owe me
took me in when my momma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and cops
not around now, all i got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man
in what not, how to brake ounces in the grams ??
the reason i'm so nice with my hands ?? shit, you think i forgot, man
thank good every day that the boy could spit
and all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
i know i got plenty more awards to get
i got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
but it wouldn't be right if i ignore the shit
they made me how i am, the music in the man
told me that i can for the world gave a damn
if it wasn't for my shit, they sayin' stick to the plan
probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
probably be doin' a dub and the pin with my man
the say leaders streets but they don't really understand
all i had was the block, when i didn't have fans
wrapped on the corners when i couldn't get spins
all i had was the homies when i didn't have kids
if it all come down and my carrier was to end, i'm sure my name
would live.. in the streets
i just can't say goodbye
i can't say goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
i can't say goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
i can't say goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
i can't say goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
you can take the man out the streets,
but you can't take the streets out the man
