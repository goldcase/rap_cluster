"(intro) i love to give you light" lyrics
snoop dogg lyrics
"(intro) i love to give you light"
say man ay ushers, deacons, lock the do'
(i love, to give you light)
geah, first of all
givin honor to god, and all the ministers on the pulpits
ushers, deacons, and my lovely choir
they sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
sing it sister..
yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this r&g
rhythm & gangsta: the masterpiece
such a, heavenly experience
alchemist, break it down for me nephew
let me preach to 'em one time, chuuch
in the beginning as a child i was chosen
though not knowin the reason while still my eyes opened
whatever the purpose, i surfaced above the fog
love was given to all, outside livin the ball
as an adolescent, one black child, i had a message
to reach teachin the masses, i wrote my first passage
it was jotted down, created in the form of a rap
i'm young, livin in the city of jackers and gangbangin
and dope dealin, cold feelin to be a product of niggaz around you
once you get on top they down you
but the temptation got me, streets caught me watchin
i found myself grindin on the streets quite often
with a blue rag, bangin the dub, fo'-fifth coffin
at the spot, 61st, 40 blocks from the eastside
where most of the big homies had a glock and flossed the g-ride
niggaz throwin up hands but it wasn't no peace signs
never fo' a second did i think to let my light shine
hardheaded, thought i was grown, messin up
disrespectin my home, not carin 'bout what moms what sayin
and then i found out that mom wasn't playin
today, i love you for it, back then, i couldn't understand
get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man
never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with
through the stripes still gotta shine my light
i've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is big snoop boss dogg
just a block and a phone call away
i've reached the status, of a modern day john baptist
i'm preachin just what i practice
to each and all, i got a word from the beach to acros the globe
man woman young and old
don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite
many circumstances doggy gon' shine my light cause i love you
(i love, to give you light)
and the people that is locked up, locked down
and the people that's locked dowwwwwn
also god, should purchase the new, escalade
on 24's, with the spinnin thangs, ha ha
i need you to, right now, look at your neighbors
cause a lot of y'all think y'all goin to heaven huh
and you ain't gon' go!
so i need you right now to, look at your neighbor
and say neighbor, say neigh-bor, you ain't goin!!
you ain't goin!!
