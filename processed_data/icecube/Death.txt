"death"
(feat. khalid abdul muhammad)
let me live my life!
we can no longer live our lives...
then let us... give our live for the liberation...
and salvation of the black nation
saints, saviors, soldiers, scholars... healers and killers
no longer dead, deaf, dumb and blind out of our my mind!
brain-washed with the white men's mind
no more homicide!
no more fratricide!
no more sucide, infantcide and... genocide!
look that goddamn white man in his cold... blue-eyes
devil don't even try... we bay bay kids!
we don't die... we... multiply!
you heard the death side
open your black eyes for the rebirth...
resurrection... and rise!
