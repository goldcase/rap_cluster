"friday"
you know it ain't no stoppin all tha doggs i'm droppin
it's friday night so everythang is poppin.
i got skin lets spin on da hand,
so let tha games begin.
yakity yak don't jump back or its on,
callin up earl on tha car phone.
mack 10 just got out of court,
rollin through tha hood in his super sport ropin too $hort.
eighteens got tha rearview mirrors vibratin,
and deep dish daytons.
you know how we do it,
ain't nuttin to it but tha floss,
overcrowdin harrison walks.
'cuz if ya fuck wit ours,
we leave scars,
out of g ride cars,
livin like stars.
might hit tha highway,
on tha vegas run fool 'cuz its friday.
oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in tha air,
if ya don't care.
standin outside on a friday livin on tha edge,
'cuz we all got 'dem hard heads.
it's seems like we all are waitin,
for a drive by playin tag wit satan.
but we chillin yeah we ready and willin,
ya hear about tha latest westside killin.
forty sippin,
set trippin,
fo' dippin,
get tha grip in,
neva slippin.
bg's tryin tah hang out,
but og said take ya little ass in tha house.
my big homey just got out,
used tah be down now he's just crack ad.
he's bout hard as darth vada
in his sweat shirt, khakis and chuck taylors.
just see him in the drive way,
gettin beat like a smoka fool 'cuz it's friday.
why must i be like dat and chase da cat,
or settle for a hoodrat.
dookie braids no dreadlocks,
flyin in and out of jail have a chicken and a cock.
and i love her 'cuz she down,
tah fuck around wit tha underground pussyhound.
and her ass is big round and wide,
jacked up makin nigga down tah ride.
smokin indo,
playin dat super nintendo,
hear a rat tat tat on my window.
gave her ass dat pelvic thrust,
don't trust tha rubber 'cuz its bound tah bust.
in tha oven in tha nappy,
i had on two so i was happy.
'cuz dat hiv'll make ya dick hang sideways,
and dat ain't cool fool 'cuz its friday.
throw tha west side in da air,
throw tha east side in da air,
throw tha south side in da air,
throw tha north side in da air.
oh yeah!
