"wicked" lyrics
ice cube lyrics
"wicked"
one, two, three and i come with the wicked
style and you know that i'm from the wicked
crew, act like you knew
cos i got everybody jumpin to the voodoo
pick it, wicked rhymes, picket signs
while me and the mob gotta truck full of 9's]
play ya and i'll slay ya
i got thug-made dough by the hey-a
ready to buck buck buck and it's a must
to duck duck duck before i bust
lookin for the one that did it
but like en vogue, no you're never gonna get it
cos i'm the one with the fat mad skills
and i won't choke like the buffalo bills
sittin at the pad just chillin
cos larry parker just got two million, oh what a feelin
so shake that nigga and pass me the pill
and i'll slam dunk ya like shaquille o'neal
like it, dig it, maybe and watch that ???
kick it cos i get wicked
won't say nuttin, just listen
got me a plan to break tyson outta prison
come my way and get served
still got a duece that'll bunny hop the curb
nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin
never seen with a happy grin
show the fat foul cos i'm down
take a look around
and all you see is big black boots steppin
use my steel toe as a weapon
kick ya and flip ya, now they want to
label this nigga, tape with the sticker
kickin out girls that's nicety
yo, i gotta body count like ice-t
from here to new york
i get skins and ain't talkin bout pork
swine, pig, dick
listen to the flow of a so-called negro
who didn't know i was funky as wilson pickett
dig it cos i get wicked
people wanna know how come
i gotta gat and i'm lookin out the window like malcolm
ready to bring that noise
kinda trigger happy like the geto boys
april 29th was power to the people
and we might just see a sequel
cos police got equal pay
a horse is a pig that don't fly straight
doin darryl gates but is willie williams
down with the pilgrims
just a super slave
we'll have to break his ass up like super dave
i'm wicked enough to board this
cos now it's on to the fullest
gorilla straight from the mist
but i don't miss when it comes to this
bring the yellow tape
the white cape, cos i'm so straight
thru with the picket signs, take his job and stick it
bigot, cos i get wicked
