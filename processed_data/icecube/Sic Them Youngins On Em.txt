ice cube lyrics
"sic them youngins on 'em"
lench mob incorporated
fuck with the godfather
see what ya get
punishment
consequences and repercussions
understand me
y'all know what i do
sic them youngins on 'em
sic them youngins on 'em
sic them youngins on 'em
sic them youngins on 'em
try to go ham on porky pig
fucked up boy, that's what you did
barbed wire, come through, split your wig
y'all can't wrestle with the giant squid
try to give dap to the iron fist
ask al green, i'm hot as grits
yarn in my hand, no pinky ring
godfather, nigga, i pull the strings
do what i tell'em, buy what i sell 'em
puppet master, i'm jim hanson
see my muppets, they like duckets
y'all better run when you see that bucket
hit that corner, do what i wanna
get another jar for the organ donor
ice cube, nigga, i know better
but you ain't gotta fight
when you got that cheddar
sic them youngins on 'em
sic them youngins on 'em
sic them youngins on 'em
sic them youngins on 'em
try to have beef with a fucking bull
with no teeth i'm about to pull
i'm that dentist this the finish
all the spoils go to the winners
don't go mad cause my hands are clean
i'm the king, never flee on the scene
wizard of oz, if you need a brain
need a heart? here's a start!
don't you worry if you need the courage
y'all motherfuckers know where you heard it
gangsta, gangsta, thank me now
rap god nigga, please take a bow
can't take bullshit from a cow
don't ask who, i'm a fuckin' owl
thirstin' howl, will get you murdered
come to the boss if you need some work
come to the boss if you need some hurt
white collar boy, if you check my shirt
here come my sons just like lavert
gotta get my boys up out the dirt
putting the rap game on alert
fuck with them and i will revert
back to the old days, back to the old ways
back to the ak's fucking up doorways
sic them youngins on 'em
sic them youngins on 'em
sic them youngins on 'em
sic them youngins on 'em
try to play chicken with a fucking rooster
don't you worry, i'm not the shooter
i m a fucking computer, with a whole army of boosters
nigga got out one piece, five piece, dime piece
cause my crimmies move like zombies
what? been here since the 90's
don't act like you don't know where to find me
now, if you wanna get slimy
look at all the grimy
niggas all behind me
you don't wanna go to war so you start to sing
why can't we be friends? we can be friends
pussy ass niggas by extent
pray to the god, repent your sins
ice cube ain't like the rest of them
sic them youngins on 'em
sic them youngins on 'em
sic them youngins on 'em
sic them youngins on 'em
try to go ham on porky pig
fucked up boy, that's what you did
try to go ham on porky pig
fucked up boy, that's what you did
try to go ham on porky pig
fucked up boy, that's what you did
try to go ham on porky pig
fucked up boy, that's what you did
