"the wash"
(feat. snoop dogg)
as the wheels turn city to city, hundreds fold, chronic smoke
twist up another philly (dun dilly)
them niggas still trippin off that old shit (really?) how silly
it's a whole 'nother day (yeah yeah) snoop dogg (and doc motherfuckin dre)
nigga can ya feel this?
it's the d-o-double, you don't run up, you won't see no trouble
if you caught up in these fuckin streets
who you gon' call when them niggas gettin ready to blast?
yeah, and if that shit's gettin ugly
who you gon' call when them niggas come to gettin ya ass?
(i came to get that ass!)
big dittog, push the big hittog
ya hoppin and poppin, how bout you hop up off my bittalls
got(got) dirt on my pittaws
i(i) broke a few littaws
it(it) really don't matter cause i'm only here to spit on
and get on, shit on niggas
do it to 'em d-o-double right on nigga
i'm saggin it, baggin it, slang them dubs
you motherfuckers think the wash is all soap and suds, whassup cuz?
if you tryin to get a dub sack, page me
the ho's say "d-loc, you so crazy"
poppin that shit don't phase me
i need my chips and the dip it's like gravy
now back to the lecture at hand
perfection is expected and i'm feelin that demand
los ang, broad day gunnin
that ain't no earthquake it's just dre comin
if this shit ain't played, the party ain't bumpin
if i don't show up, the ho's ain't fuckin
cali sunshine, come visit
just don't stop at stop signs with bullet holes in it
all star league, you writin benjamins
i handles my business, fuck fake niggas
i sell game a quarter million a track
snoop and the good doc back with a brand new sack
shit's wrong, money gone, i blast
out of town, out of bounds, no pass
runnin up, talkin shit, get smashed
shoot first, ask questions last
fallin back on that ass, hit the switch and let the ass just drag(zzzt zzt)
2001, 2002 taz
my nigga what you holdin?
step out with the stacy's and the snoop dogg clothing
rollin, with the braids in my hair
crimped out, way pimped out, oh yeah
you gots to pay the cost to beat the boss
after all that dirt i gots to get my shit washed
the wash
(ahhhh)
the wash
(ahh, ahh)
the wash
(ahhhh, ahhh)
