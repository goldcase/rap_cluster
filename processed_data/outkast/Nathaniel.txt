"nathaniel"
shit man
nigga gotta go on the got down
get the shit straight when i got damn get out
well shit
this what really goin down
whassup my nigga another day the same shit
punk-ass c.o.'s on a nigga dick
got me up at three o'clock cookin nappy grits
i'm a g from c.p. i can't take the shit
tryin to hold a nigga down in this country ass town
i'm used to smokin chronic movin pounds
they got a nigga on some "sir, yessir, left right left"
throw me in a hole if my ass outta step
they treat you like a motherfuckin slave
dopefiends, cryin jesus, swear they saved
niggaz better get they game tight
cause these crackers tryin to take a nigga life and they rights
i'm surrounded by fake-ass crooks
they swear they kingpins but don't have money on they books
i hear so many lies it make me sick
these niggaz called ballers sellin dimes and licks
i can't wait til the day they let me go
so i can eat some steak and shrimp
grab a mic, and bust a flow
i'm audi 5 nigga lights out
hold it down on the streets until the day that i get out
i'm out man
