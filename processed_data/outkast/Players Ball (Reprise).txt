"player's ball (reprise)"
here's a little somethin for the players out there hustlin
gettin down for theirs
from east pointe, college park, decatur, devries...
my man, the scene was so thick
lowriders, seventy-seven sevilles
el do's, nuttin but them 'llacs
all the players (deporte in the house) all the hustlers
i'm talkin bout a black man heaven here
youknowhati'msayin? yeah
cadillacs are comin, from everywhere (yeahhh)
limbo boppin good cause love is in the air
to all you players and you pimps smoke out and have a ball
and if your hoe is actin crazy --
-- put her on the wall
now now now everybody's dancin and just feelin right
i see all of you players got yourselves laid in on ice
i hope when all y'all dance is over, can i get onn, yeah
my kids'll have a story, that still be told, whoooa, about
all the players came, from far and wide
wearin afros and braids, kickin them gangster rides
now i'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
when the player ball is happenin, all day eryday
