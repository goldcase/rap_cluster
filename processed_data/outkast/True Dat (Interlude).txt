outkast lyrics
"true dat (interlude)"
operatin' under the crooked american system too long
outkast, pronounced outcast
adjective meaning homeless, or unaccepted in society
but let's look deeper than that
are you an outkast?
if you understand and feel the basic principles and
fundamental truths contained within this muzik, you probably are
if you think it's all about pimpin hoes and slammin cadillac doughs
you probably a cracker, or a nigga that think he a cracker
or maybe just don't understand
an outkast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world
he's looked at differently
he's not accepted because of his clothes, his hair
his occupation, his beliefs or his skin color
now look at yourself, are you an outkast? i know i am
as a matter of fact, fuck being anythang else
it's only so much time left in this crazy world
wake up niggaz and realize what's goin on around you
poisonin' of the food and water
tamperin' of cigarettes
disease engineering control over your life
take back your existence or die like a punk
this is big rube, sayin right on to the real, and death to the fakers
peace out
