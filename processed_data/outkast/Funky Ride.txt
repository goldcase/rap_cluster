"funky ride" lyrics
outkast lyrics
"funky ride"
let me take you on a funky ride
all around the world
and ahh, if you let me give inside your mind
feel your spirits fly
oh baby, would you like to take a little ride with me
unleash your sexual fantasies
it would be so nice
ahh, relax your body next to me
as i sing this outkast melody
on this funky ride
so just relax baby
now baby, now the smoke is in the air
montell and co. has got me there
and we wonder why you're high?
well baby umm, it's nothin but that
sess in your chest that got you feelin kinda crazy
so let your spirits fly
uhh and enjoy the ride
oh yeah baby
