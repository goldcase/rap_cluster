"greatest show on earth"
(feat. macy gray)
how ya'll feelin' tonight?
i don't give a damn
mama i'm leavin' way from home to join the circus
and papa i go into that place where them clowns get down (get down)
sister i know that there are lions tigers and bears
i'll be safe and sure to call ya'll when i get there
nothing but the greatest show on earth
(shut up while i'm singing) step right up step right up come one come all
what u want what u need
wanna drank wanna chief
i got it yeah i got it
mama i'm moving up and i'll be selling cotton candy
and papa next week they'll let me sit on the trapeze-eze whoo
uncle you should see all these dancing girls
and every night i get to sleep under the big top
ain't nothing like...great
it's the greatest show on earth
da da da da da da
what u want what u need
wanna drank wanna chief

ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh whoa

i got green love
i got blue love
