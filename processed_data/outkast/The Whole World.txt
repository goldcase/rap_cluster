"the whole world"
(feat. killer mike)
okay, here we go
yeah i'm afraid, like i'm scared as a dog
but i've got a new song, and i want y'all to sang alooooooong
sang aloooooooooong..
see this is the way that we walk on a sunny, day
when it's rainin inside and you're, all alooooooooone
all aloooooooooone - yeah!
cause the whole, world, loves it when you don't get down
(bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
and the whole, world, loves it when you make that sound
(bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
and the whole, world, loves it when you're in the news
(bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
and the whole, world, loves it when you sang the blues
(bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
take a little trip, hater pack up yo' mind
look forward not behind, then you'll see what you find
i caught a sucker dyin cause he thought could rhyme
now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime
i gotta meet her, don't take no shorts i don't use abbrevi-
-ation, i don't even play the radio neither
only if i need to know the sports or the weather
i'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head i'll sever
from the neck - see ain't nuttin changed, hit the stage
set a date sucker, in battle we can engage
i'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
throw the porsche at you, is what i'm forced to do
with my back against the wall, crack his back y'all
naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin hair with stylin gel in it
throw a curl in it
dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
and this for dem niggaz workin at the airpo't
who got laid off, i take my shades off
if you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
because the whole, whole, world, world
player i grind, my focus is crime
raw with the rhyme, i'm slick with the slime
my words are diamonds dug out a mine
spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
i catch a beat runnin like randy moss
ride dat bitch off like a brand new horse
i'm rollin my stone, gatherin no moss
mami i'm comin i hope you get off
or rock your own boat like aaliyah then talk
back, back, forth, forth
get that sailor on course, course
make that track a corpse, corpse
rap, roll, utterly rocked
with my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
cadillac outkast just won't stop
turn on the tv and everything is lookin dismal
went in the bathroom medicine cabinet pepto-bismal
need it for my stomach cause my tummy kinda aches
like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
wait, back to the enemy of the state
is the republicans or democratic candidate
debate, now even the black box hold the fate
clueless like shaggy and scooby befo' commercial break
hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
if you want to you can dub it to your hit list
i know you gon' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
when it come to this music we stay relentless
pursuing all that's pursuable
doing god's willing all things that are doable
the only liable limitation is yourself
dre set it on the right and i'll set it on the left, cause
